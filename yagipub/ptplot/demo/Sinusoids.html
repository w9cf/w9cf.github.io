<h1>Plot data generated in Java</h1>

The plot below shows a collection
of sinusoids plotted with each sample explicitly shown with a
vertical line.
Like the <a href="FourierSeries.html">Fourier series demo</a>,
this one uses Java code to compute the data on the fly.

<p>
The <a href="PlotDemo.java">source code</a>
defines a class <code>PlotDemo</code>
derived from <code>Plot</code>.  This class contains a sequence of Java
statements in its <code>init()</code> method that configures and constructs
the plot.  This particular example also demonstrates a number of features.
In particular, 
the X and Y ranges are given explicitly in the Java code,
but note that the Y (vertical) range
is insufficient to contain all the points.
The lines are clipped at the boundary of the range.
Clicking on the "fill" button at the upper right brings all data within range.
Note further that the Y axis is labeled with explicitly given tick marks,
this time placed at non-integer positions, and again given string labels.
Notice also that the "impulses" feature is turned on, causing a line to drawn
from each plotted point down to the x axis.
This provides an alternative way to explicitly show each sample
being plotted (vs. marks as in the
<A HREF="Marks.html">marks demo</A>).
