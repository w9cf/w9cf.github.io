<p>
The following pages contain examples of the Plot class, which draws
various kinds of two-dimensional plots of data.
 <P>
While every effort has been made to make these demos work with popular
browsers, the reality is that 
Java is a relatively immature language, and different
browsers and installations support different versions.
Please let us know if you encounter difficulties.
<p>
One known problem is that if you have a
CLASSPATH environment set when you started your browser, you may get
an error message when accessing some of the demos.
We suggest unsetting this environment variable, restarting your
browser (and sending email to Sun's Java team to complain about the
way the CLASSPATH environment variable works).
