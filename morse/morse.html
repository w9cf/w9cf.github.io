This applet will send morse code, corresponding to
the text in the box on the right, through your
sound card (use your computer's volume controls to control the volume).
It can import a text file using the <font color="blue">
File->Read text file</font>
menu item. It can produce a wave file as output using the
<font color="blue"> File->Write wave file</font> menu item. The speed in
words per minute, the tone frequency in Hz, and the rise
time of the keying in milliseconds are input parameters.

The speed uses the standard word PARIS, so a dot is 1200/wpm milliseconds
full width at half maximum. The rise time is the smaller of the given
rise time and 150/wpm.

To start, type something in the large text area on the right and click the
<font color="red">play</font> button.

You can also run this as a java application. Download (right click)
<a href="http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/morse/morse.jar">morse.jar</a>,
and either click on it to run it, or on a command line try
<br>
java -jar morse.jar
<br>
or
<br>
javaw -jar morse.jar
<br>
in the directory where you saved morse.jar.
<br>
<br>
I use <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">lame</a>
to convert the wave files to mp3 files.
I find that
<br>
lame --highpass 300 --lowpass 1500 -h filename.wav filename.mp3
<br>
works well and does not produce annoying artefacts.
<br>
<br>
A command line text to wave converter is also included in morse.jar.
I find it convenient to use in scripts. If you have downloaded morse.jar
<br> 
java -cp morse.jar morse.audio.MorseWave file.txt file.wav 45 600 1
<br>
will produce the wave file, file.wav, from the text file, file.txt,
at 45 wpm, 600 Hz tone, with a 1 millisecond rise time.

The source code is available <a href="http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/morse/morsesrc.jar">here</a>.
