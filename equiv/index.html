An Equivalent Diameter Calculator For Rectangular Cross Section Conductors
</center>

<p>
To use the applet type in new values in the width and thickness fields,
and click the calculate button. You must click the calculate button for
the new values to take effect.
The self impedance equivalent diameter that you would use in antenna
modeling is calculated, and the equivalent diameter for the r.f. resistivity
is calculated as well. Be sure to use the same units for width and length
that is both in millimeters, or both in inches etc. The equivalent diameters
will be in the same units.
<p>
The plot on the right displays the calculated current distribution around
the conductor in red.
Zero on the x axis of the plot is the center of the wider
dimension I'll assume that is the width.
Larger x is moving along the perimeter of the conductor so
the corner is at x=width/2. The current density diverges there (but the
total current is of course finite) as is well known. Larger x values
correspond to moving along the shorter side. Again only half the thickness
is shown. The current on the other parts of the surface are given by
symmetry. The blue line is the value of current that would occur if
the same total current flowed uniformly around the surface.

To run applet locally without downloading and compiling the source,
you can download the java class files from
<a href="http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/equiv/equiv.zip">
http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/equiv/equiv.zip</a> and unzip that file
in any convenient directory on your system. Also download the file
you are looking at now
<a href="http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/equiv/index.html">
http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/equiv/index.html</a>. You can use the
save as function of your browser.  Call this file index.html, and place
it in the
same directory that you unzipped equiv.zip in, and point your browser
at it.
