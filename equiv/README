Here is the source for the rectangular cross section equivalent diameter
applet. I put a copyright and the GNU general public license on it. This
makes it legal to copy and modify it as much as you want. It mostly
only requires you to label any changes as your own and make the source
available if you distribute it.  Read the copying file for details. If
this is a problem for someone, let me know, and we can discuss it.

Equiv.java = the main applet code. This sets up the GUI stuff, and calls
the RectangularCrossSection class that does all the real work.

RectangularCrossSection.java = class that calculates the equivalant
diameters as described in my notes at http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf

EllipticIntegral.java = this are the elliptic integral routines. They
are mostly a straight rewrite of the slatec fortran routines drd.f drf.f
available from http://www.netlib.org.

ptplot subdirectory contains a modified version of ptplot. The original
version is available free from http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot.

The Makefile shows how I compile everything under unix.
