SBDVP with CT and NA
</title>

<h1>Does SBDVP work with CT and NA?</h1>

Several people have asked me if SBDVP,
which uses the DVP interface of TRlog to make a sound card voice
keyer, will also work with CT and NA.
I haven't tried it, and no one has reported it working, so 
the short answer is no. There are several issues:

<ul>
<li>I believe that CT and NA use extended memory to store the log.
If they happen to grab all available extended memory, SBDVP
would need to be changed to allocate a fixed amount of extended
memory when it is first started. The current algorithm allocates
memory only when a recording is started or when an audio file
is read in.

<li>I believe CT and NA can be set up to send call signs and exchanges
that change, e.g. serial numbers, without a human saying anything into
the microphone by using the dvp to send separate letter/number audio
files as well as other canned messages.  Because of the way I set up
the extended memory for SBDVP, there is a limit of around 100 audio
files that can be sent using SBDVP. This could be fixed, but TR can't
use this many anyway, so I didn't put in better memory management. If
you want to save some CQs and fixed exchanges, etc. the current method
should work fine in CT or NA too.

<li>I don't have documentation for the K1EA DVP, so I wrote a little
code that intercepted the commands that TR sends to the DVP when I push
various keys. After looking at this output I was able to reverse
engineer enough of the interface to the DVP to make TR use SBDVP as a
simple voice keyer. It is likely that CT and NA will make somewhat
different calls to the DVP and therefore SBDVP won't work with
them.  Since I give away the C source code to SBDVP, It is probably an
evening's work to make SBDVP work, as a simple voice keyer, with CT and NA
for anyone who:
<ul>

   <li>Is a competent C programmer.
   <li>Has a copy of the Borland Turbo-C compiler that SBDVP was written
      in (or any other DOS C compiler if you translate the Borland
      library calls, etc.).
   <li>Has a copy of CT or NA -- in addition a copy of any programming
      documentation for the K1EA DVP would be a big help.
   <li>Is able to figure out what I did in my code -- various ugly
      coding is used since I don't understand DOS.  For example I store
      lots of stuff in static global variables, because I don't know
      how local variables are allocated for interrupt routines.
      I normally write scientific codes mostly on unix systems.
      I hate working with Microsoft operating systems,
      particularly the toy ones i.e. DOS and Windows 95/98,
      so I keep my use of them
      to a minimum. I may be doing something stupid because of my lack
      of DOS knowledge.
</ul>

<li>It is possible that there are other problems with using SBDVP with
CT and NA that I am unaware of since I don't have or use those loggers.
</ul>
