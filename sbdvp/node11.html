10 Windows Sound System Compatible Sound Cards</A>
</H1>
<P><A NAME="wss">&#160;</A>
I have included experimental support for Windows Sound System compatible
chips. To use these you need to include the command line flag -w8 or -w16,
i.e. use
<BR>
SBDVP -w8
<BR>
or
<BR>
SBDVP -w16
<BR>
which will play/record 8 bit samples at a 11KHz rate or 16 bit samples
at at 16 KHz sampling rate.  In addition you must set the environment
variable WSS for example,
set WSS=A530 I5 D1
where 530 should be replaced by the I/O address of the WSS card,
5 with the hardware interrupt, and 1 with the playback DMA of the
WSS card (this is normally the first DMA listed when 2 are given).
<P>
The Windows Sound System (WSS) or Microsoft Sound System was a sound
card produced by Microsoft that is no longer made; I don't think
Microsoft makes any sound hardware now.  It used an Analog Devices
AD1848 as its sound chip. I think that when manufacturers say that
their sound card is Windows Sound System compatible, they mean that to
some degree it is compatible with the AD1848 chip. I could not find a
data sheet for the AD1848, but the Analog Devices web site says that
the AD1845 is the nearest current equivalent, and its data sheet is
available on line. I have access to two computers that have sound cards
that claim to be WSS compatible. The first uses an Opti 82C924 chip,
and the second uses a Crystal CS4236 chip. Data sheets for both of
these chips are available at the Opti and Cirrus Logic Web sites
respectively. The data sheets for the CS4236 and AD1845 give enough
details to learn how to program the WSS.
<P>
The documentation for my soundcards gives the usual default
Windows Sound System ``I/O Address'' as hex 530.
Other standard
I/O addresses are hex 640, E80, and F40.
To use the Opti sound
card in WSS mode, I first make sure that the DOS initialization utility
has initialized the card in WSS mode.
I then set the
WSS environment variable to tell SBDVP
that the I/O address is 0x530, the DMA is 1, and the interrupt is 5.
My Crystal CS4236 based sound system is the sound system on the
Intel PRO 440FX motherboard. It automatically detects whether it
is being used in 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster^{TM}} -->
 <I>SoundBlaster</I><SUP> TM</SUP> or WSS mode. I have both the BLASTER and WSS
environment variables defined, and by firing up SBDVP with or
without the -w8 option I can use it in either WSS or 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster^{TM}} -->
 <I>SoundBlaster</I><SUP> TM</SUP> mode.
<P>
Nearly all of the newer WSS compatible chips allow the use
of 2 DMA channels and can be set up for simultaneous 16 bit
playback and record. While this would be useful to properly emulate the
back copy function of the K1EA DVP, I haven't bothered with this.
If yours is setup with separate DMA channels just list the playback
channel as the DMA in the WSS statement.
<P>
The advantages to using the WSS driver are that it can use 16 bit
samples for higher quality, and some WSS chips have a FIFO to reduce
or eliminate pops due to other computer activity. The Soundblaster
16 has these same advantages, but I do not have access to one
to test out code, so I do not support these Soundblaster 16 features.
If you are having trouble in Sound Blaster mode and your card is
WSS compatible, consider trying it in WSS mode.
