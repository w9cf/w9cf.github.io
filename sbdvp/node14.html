13 Memory management</A>
</H1>
<P>
SBDVP.EXE uses an extended memory handle for every audio file.
The number of extended memory handles can be increased
up to a maximum of 128 by using /NUMHANDLES=128 as a parameter
when installing HIMEM.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file. The default
number is 32, and some of these may be used by other
drivers etc. that use extended memory. It costs 6 bytes of conventional
memory per
handle. Although TR has about 30 default file names, you will
probably only use 
a CQ and a few default exchanges. If the small number of available
file handles  
becomes a problem the code can be rewritten.
Eventually, if I get time,
I'll change to using a single extended memory handle.
Internally SBDVP
has a limit of 40 audio file names set by the parameter MAXFILES.
This can trivially increased and the code recompiled if needed.
<P>
Every time you choose to record a function, the following steps are
taken.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>If audio for the function exists, its extended memory handle is freed.
<DT>2.
<DD>A new extended memory handle is allocated with the maximum
amount of contiguous free extended memory. This allows the recording
to be as large as possible.
<DT>3.
<DD>When the recording is stopped by hitting escape, the extended
memory associated with the file is truncated to the length of
the recording.
</DL>
<P>
The audio data is written to your hard disk only when you unload
SBDVP using
<BR>
SBDVP -u
<BR>
The file name will be the file name used by TR when the audio was
recorded.
<P>
Neither SBDVP.EXE or the HIMEM.SYS driver does anything very clever,
so if
you make a lot of rerecordings, you can fragment your extended memory
space so that a recording cannot be as large as the amount of
free extended memory.
As an example, assume you have 4 functions recorded each
using 100Kbytes,
and you have 1 Megabyte of extended memory total. If you decide
to rerecord the second file, it will free up the block of 100Kbytes,
and then allocate the largest block of contiguous extended memory, which will
be the 600Kbytes at the top of extended memory. If the new recording
takes 100Kbytes, the memory will look like 100K for file 1, 100K free,
300K for files 3,4 and the new number 2, and finally 500K free.
The largest contiguous free block is now 500K. Continued random rerecording
will further fragment the extended memory. If this becomes a
problem, a work around is to exit TR, unload SBDVP using the
command SBDVP -U, and then rerun SBDVP using SBDVPCFG.DAT 
with the list of files you want.
