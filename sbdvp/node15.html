<P>
When the DVP is enabled in TR, it looks to see if DVPTSR is loaded
by examining the 0x60 interrupt address to see if the label
DVPTSR00 is in the eight bytes before the interrupt driver. SBDVP
also sets itself up this way so that TR will know that the DVP
interrupt is available. TR then queries the DVP driver to find
a shared memory area where it transfers file names and commands.
When you press function keys on TR that need to communicate
with the DVP, TR puts filenames and commands in the shared memory
area and generates interrupt 0x60. SBDVP installs an interrupt
routine that is called when TR generates interrupt 0x60. This
routine parses the commands from TR to see what to do.
<P>
SBDVP when first installed not only takes over interrupt 0x60,
but it also installs an interrupt routine that copies data
between extended memory and a buffer that is used by the
direct memory access chips that connect to the sound card.
<P>
If TR tells SBDVP to transmit CQF1.DVP, the following steps
are taken
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>TR executes interrupt(s) 0x60 with filename CQF1.DVP, and the
commands to transmit the audio
<DT>2.
<DD>The SBDVP interrupt 0x60 routine parses the commands and then
locates the extended memory area that contains the audio to be
sent. It communicates with the DMA controller and the sound card
to tell them to work together to transmit the audio in autoinitiate
mode. This means the DMA just sends the same buffer over
and over until it is told to stop. SBDVP copies
the first data from  extended memory to a conventional memory buffer,
tells the DMA to start transmitting the buffer to the sound card,
and tells the sound card to output the audio
and to interrupt after half the buffer is sent.
<DT>3.
<DD>When the sound card sends the interrupt, the half of the buffer
that has been sent is overwritten with new data that is
copied from extended memory, and the interrupt
controller is reset.
<DT>4.
<DD>When the audio is all sent the sound card is reset
</DL>
<P>
Recording is done similarly except that all the data directions
are reversed. Additionally, a note is made of any newly recorded
audio. When SBDVP is unloaded, using SBDVP -u,
any newly recorded data is copied to hard disk so that it can be
reloaded if desired. If the computer is shut off or crashes before
SBDVP is unloaded, any newly recorded data will be lost. If you want
to make sure that a recording is saved you must unload SBDVP and
then restart it with the appropriate SBDVPCFG.DAT file.
