1 Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p>
This describes the code SBDVP.EXE. It uses TR's existing
interface to the K1EA digital voice processor card.
I have not implemented the backcopy features of the K1EA card,
so don't attempt to use them.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000">
2 System Requirements</a>
</h1>
<p>
To use SBDVP.EXE, you need:
<ul>
<li>
a 80386 or better processor,
<li>
Some free extended memory installed. You also need a driver
like HIMEM.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file. At the default sampling
rate, you need 12Kbytes of extended memory for each
second of stored audio. One megabyte of extended memory
will therefore store over 80 seconds of audio. You can see how
much free extended memory you have by typing MEM at the DOS
prompt.
<li>
A 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 2.0, Pro, or 16 or compatible or a Windows Sound System
compatible soundcard.
I have tested it using my 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> pro
compatible card. The commands I use are also available on the 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 
2.0  and 16 so they should also work. I have modified the code
to work on the 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 1.X cards. These cards do not support autoinitiate
DMA modes, and the recordings in particular are much lower quality.
See the section using 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 1.X cards below.
<li>
You need 
a separate microphone connected to your sound card or a method of switching
the rig microphone to the sound card, and a connection from the sound card
output to your rig transmit audio input. This may need an attenuator
and/or impedance matching to work with your rig. SBDVP can toggle
a data line on a parallel port when recording to help with interfacing
your rig microphone.
<li>
You either need to have one of the serial or parallel ports
wired for push to talk as in the TR manual, or use VOX control
for your rig.
<p></ul><h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000">
3 Program Operation</a>
</h1>
<p>
Most of this manual will assume that you are using a 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> card.
If you are using a Windows Sound System compatible sound card,
the slight changes you need to make are described in section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808151731/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/sbdvp/dvp.html#wss">10</a>.
Make sure that your sound card is set up for microphone input.
SBDVP doesn't manipulate those settings. Use one of the utilities
that came with the sound card to change any input, output, and
volume settings.
<p>
My CONFIG.SYS file contains the line
<br>
STACKS=9,256
<br>
which defines 9, 256 byte, hardware interrupt stacks. Nearly all
of my testing has been done with this statement in CONFIG.SYS, but
I have tested it with
STACKS=0,0
<br>
which defines no hardware stacks and it seemed to work.
<p>
If you will be using vox,
start the code by typing
<br>
SBDVP
<br>
If you want to use push to talk, you need an interface
exactly like the CW ones described in the TR manual. If you already
use push to talk on CW, you are all set. The interface
can be on a parallel or serial port. If it is on parallel
port 2, start the code by typing
<br>
SBDVP -p2
<br>
replace the 2 by the correct parallel port if it is not port 2.
Alternatively if you want to use a serial port for push to talk,
then for serial port 2 type,
<br>
SBDVP -s2
<br>
where again you should replace 2 with the number of the serial
port you are using if it is not 2.
The code will look for a standard BLASTER environment variable. This
is normally set up in AUTOEXEC.BAT when your sound card is installed.
It should be a line like
<br>
SET BLASTER= A220 I5 D1 T4
<br>
It may have additional entries, but only these are looked at
by SBDVP. If this is already set, then you can just try
running SBDVP. If not then you need to set this up first.
The Axxx needs xxx set to the hexadecimal address of
the sound card. Dx needs x set to the 8 bit DMA channel of the
sound card. It must be 0, 1 or 3 for SBDVP to work. Ix needs x
set to the hardware interrupt of the sound card.
Finally, Tx gives the type
of sound card you have. This is only used by SBDVP to detect

<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 1.X cards. In that case autoinitiate transfers are turned
off.
In the future,
I plan to turn on the FIFO memory on the 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 16 for better
audio quality when I get access to one to test it. Tx with
x = 1 is the

<p>
SBDVP will also attempt to open the file SBDVPCFG.DAT in the current
directory and if this
file exists SBDVP will read a list of file names
(just file names, not full path names) each on a single
line. These should match the file names that TR uses and be
audio files that were produced previously. The file SBDVPCFG.DAT
should not be used the first time you fire up SBDVP.
<p>
The program if successful will terminate but stay resident. If you type
<br>
MEM/P/C
<br>
at the DOS prompt, you will get a list of programs in memory. You
should see SBDVP listed along with the amount of memory that it
is using (about 25Kbytes). You can unload the program by typing
<br>
SBDVP -u
<br>
at the DOS prompt.
If you have available high memory (use MEM to find out),
you can load SBDVP into high memory leaving extra conventional
memory for
TR, by typing
<br>
LOADHIGH SBDVP
<br>
The program can be unloaded using
<br>
SBDVP -u
<br>
as in the usual case.
To use LOADHIGH, you need to have EMM386.EXE or equivalent
loaded after
HIMEM.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file and you need to tell DOS to manage
the upper memory blocks by including DOS=UMB,HIGH in CONFIG.SYS.
See your DOS manual if you need more details. Typically running
MEMMAKER will add EMM386 and the DOS commands automatically.
<p>
To try out the DVP, make sure a microphone and speaker(s) are
connected to
the sound card.
Fire up TR as usual, and use the Control-J menu to choose
<br>
ENABLE DVP = TRUE.
<br>
In SSB mode, you should now see DVP ON, and you should be able
to toggle between DVP on and off using Alt-K.
Function keys are programmed as described in the TR manual.
Press Control-F1 to start recording CQF1.DVP and say a CQ
into the microphone. When you finish press ESCAPE to terminate
the recording. Pressing F1 will send your CQ out the speaker.
Hit ESCAPE just like
in CW to terminate the output before it finishes.
<p>
You can program all the function keys using the Alt-P command
as described in the TR manual.
If you subsequently unload SBDVP using the SBDVP -u command,
a file with the name shown while recording it will be produced
or overwritten in the current directory.
If you add these file names
as single lines in SBDVPCFG.DAT,
SBDVP will load them when it is started in that directory.
The BACKCOPY functions have not been implemented. <em>Do not</em>
enable BACKCOPY - unpredictable things may happen.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION00050000000000000000">
4 Sampling rate selection</a>
</h1>
<p>
The default sampling rate of 12048 Hz is a compromise between
sampling quality and speed. Higher rates with only 
8 bit samples don't increase the quality substantially since the signal
to noise ratio is not very high. Lower rates will give lower 
quality audio, but the recordings will take up less memory. 
If you want to change the sampling rate, start SBDVP with the  
command
<br>
SBDVP -rnnnn
<br>
where nnnn is the sampling integer rate in Hertz. For example,
<br>
SBDVP -r8000
<br>
will set the sampling rate to 8000 Hz. If you record at one
setting and play back at another you get the usual frequency 
and speed shift. This will be most useful to annoy your friends 
during multiops. The -r option can be used with the -p or -s options
for push to talk operation.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION00060000000000000000">
5 Push to Talk</a>
</h1>
<p>
As mentioned above,
if you use push to talk, you need to have a push to talk interface
attached to a serial or parallel port as described in the TR manual.
Include on the command line either -pn where n is replaced by the number of
the parallel port (1, 2, or 3), or include -sn where n is replaced
by the number of the serial port (1, 2, 3, or 4). SBDVP.EXE
looks up the corresponding port address in the ROM bios area and
toggles the request to send line on the serial port or it toggles
the init and strobe lines on the parallel port. This should work
fine for single radio contesting. Two radio contesting with one
radio calling CQ using the voice keyer while you are copying
an exchange on a second radio (or whatever you two radio guys
do - I can barely operate one) will require Tree to modify
TR to operate the push to talk in SSB mode and keep track of which
radio is transmitting. If neither a -pn or -sn option is included
on the command line of SBDVP.EXE push to talk output from SBDVP
will be disabled, and you need to use vox.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION00070000000000000000">
6 Switching the rig microphone</a>
</h1>
<p>
The simplest method is to use separate microphones for the
soundcard and your rig. To help with interfacing the rig microphone
to the soundcard, SBDVP can make one of the parallel port data
lines (pins 2 to 9 on the DB25 connector) go high when you are
recording. This line can be used with an external circuit
to switch the rig microphone to the soundcard. To enable this,
add the command line switch -m2p1. This stands for microphone
pin 2 parallel port 1. You can set the pin number from 2 to 9
and the parallel port number can be 1 to 3. For example,
to use both push to talk and toggle pin 5 of parallel port
1 when recording you would start SBDVP with
<br>
SBDVP -m5p1 -p1
<br>
<p><h1><a name="SECTION00080000000000000000">
7 Audio connections</a>
</h1>
<p>
I use a separate microphone connected to the sound card. The output
jack of my sound card is an 1/8 inch stereo phone jack. I use
a Radio Shack ``Dual Stereo Headphone Adapter'' part number
274-313, to give me two outputs. One output goes to the computer speakers
in the usual way
so that I can monitor the audio. I run one channel (the output
of my card is stereo) of the other output across a 100K 
ohm potentiometer and run the wiper arm of the pot to the back
panel audio input of the rig (in this case N7LR's TenTec Corsair).
I mounted the pot in a small aluminum box and used RG-174 to 
keep the connections shielded. 
Kenwood owners might want to check out technical correspondence 
page 71, June 1996, QST, where KN3C describes hooking the
audio output of a 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 2.0 to the data input of a TS-850.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION00090000000000000000">
8 Switching off the rig microphone</a>
</h1>
<p>
When I use the soundcard, the rig microphone will also modulate the
transmitter. If you want to carry on a conversation while the
soundcard is playing, you need to switch off the rig microphone
or otherwise disable it while the soundcard is outputting audio.
The command line switch -oxpy, will cause pin x (must be 2-9) of
parallel port y (must be  1-3) to go high while the soundblaster
is transmitting. The syntax is exactly the same as the microphone
switching line above except it starts with -o instead of -m.
You need to build an external interface to use this line
to control the switching of your rig input.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION000100000000000000000">
Using the 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 1.X</a>
</h1>
<p>
The older 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 1.0 and 1.5 cards do not support autoinitiate DMA
transfers. This means that the CPU has to intervene to reprogram
the sound card at the end of every buffer transfer, leading to
gaps that make the sound quality poorer. I have found that 
sound quality for playing sound files is adequate without autoinitiate
mode, but the recording quality is somewhere between terrible and
almost acceptable.
If for some reason your card doesn't support
autoinitiate transfers and doesn't have T1 set in the blaster environment
variable, you can force autoinitiate DMA transfers off by including
-a on the command line, i.e.,
<br>
SBDVP -a
<br>
To make the record quality better, the sound buffer can be made larger
so the gaps occur less frequently. I have included a version of the
executable SBDVPB.EXE that is identical to SBDVP.EXE except that it
has been compiled with the option -DBLOCK_LENGTH=4096, which increases
the sound buffer to 8K. This necessarily increases the code size by
16K, and the memory use will be around 40K. If you can use the loadhigh
command, this doesn't matter, otherwise this memory cannot be used by
TR, and you need to decide what to do. One ``solution'' is to use
SBDVPB before the contest to record your files, and then use SBDVP
during the contest, but don't make any recordings with it. Another
``solution'' is to record on a friends computer that has a newer
card, and use these files during the contest.
<p>
If you have a 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> 2.0, Pro, or 16, none of this concerns you and you should
always use SBDVP <em>without</em> -a.

10 Windows Sound System Compatible Sound Cards</a>
</h1>
<p><a name="wss">&#160;</a>
I have included experimental support for Windows Sound System compatible
chips. To use these you need to include the command line flag -w8 or -w16,
i.e. use
<br>
SBDVP -w8
<br>
or
<br>
SBDVP -w16
<br>
which will play/record 8 bit samples at a 11KHz rate or 16 bit samples
at at 16 KHz sampling rate.  In addition you must set the environment
variable WSS for example,
set WSS=A530 I5 D1
where 530 should be replaced by the I/O address of the WSS card,
5 with the hardware interrupt, and 1 with the playback DMA of the
WSS card (this is normally the first DMA listed when 2 are given).
<p>
The Windows Sound System (WSS) or Microsoft Sound System was a sound
card produced by Microsoft that is no longer made; I don't think
Microsoft makes any sound hardware now.  It used an Analog Devices
AD1848 as its sound chip. I think that when manufacturers say that
their sound card is Windows Sound System compatible, they mean that to
some degree it is compatible with the AD1848 chip. I could not find a
data sheet for the AD1848, but the Analog Devices web site says that
the AD1845 is the nearest current equivalent, and its data sheet is
available on line. I have access to two computers that have sound cards
that claim to be WSS compatible. The first uses an Opti 82C924 chip,
and the second uses a Crystal CS4236 chip. Data sheets for both of
these chips are available at the Opti and Cirrus Logic Web sites
respectively. The data sheets for the CS4236 and AD1845 give enough
details to learn how to program the WSS.
<p>
The documentation for my soundcards gives the usual default
Windows Sound System ``I/O Address'' as hex 530.
Other standard
I/O addresses are hex 640, E80, and F40.
To use the Opti sound
card in WSS mode, I first make sure that the DOS initialization utility
has initialized the card in WSS mode.
I then set the
WSS environment variable to tell SBDVP
that the I/O address is 0x530, the DMA is 1, and the interrupt is 5.
My Crystal CS4236 based sound system is the sound system on the
Intel PRO 440FX motherboard. It automatically detects whether it
is being used in 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> or WSS mode. I have both the BLASTER and WSS
environment variables defined, and by firing up SBDVP with or
without the -w8 option I can use it in either WSS or 
<!-- MATH: {\rm SoundBlaster}^{ TM} -->
 <i>SoundBlaster</i> <sup>TM</sup> mode.
<p>
Nearly all of the newer WSS compatible chips allow the use
of 2 DMA channels and can be set up for simultaneous 16 bit
playback and record. While this would be useful to properly emulate the
back copy function of the K1EA DVP, I haven't bothered with this.
If yours is setup with separate DMA channels just list the playback
channel as the DMA in the WSS statement.
<p>
The advantages to using the WSS driver are that it can use 16 bit
samples for higher quality, and some WSS chips have a FIFO to reduce
or eliminate pops due to other computer activity. The Soundblaster
16 has these same advantages, but I do not have access to one
to test out code, so I do not support these Soundblaster 16 features.
If you are having trouble in Sound Blaster mode and your card is
WSS compatible, consider trying it in WSS mode.

11 Mixer Settings</a>

<p>
I have set the mixer settings for the Sound Blaster Pro to what
I think are reasonable ones. If these don't work on your system,
you can disable all mixer changes by using the -v option on SBDVP.

12 Windows Operation</a>
</h1>
<p>
I have successfully fired up Windows 3.1, and then in a DOS window
used SBDVP and then TR. I could play the files that I loaded
in with SBDVPCFG.DAT. To record, I have to first record
something from the microphone
using one of the windows sound utilities. This seems
to set the correct microphone input. Also I have to use
the PIF editor to lock extended memory and disallow background
processes. However, the windows sound quality seems worse than the
same recordings under DOS, and the likelihood of having problems
is much higher since I don't really know what windows is doing
and how SBDVP and TR interact with Windows.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION000140000000000000000">
13 Memory management</a>
</h1>
<p>
SBDVP.EXE uses an extended memory handle for every audio file.
The number of extended memory handles can be increased
up to a maximum of 128 by using /NUMHANDLES=128 as a parameter
when installing HIMEM.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file. The default
number is 32, and some of these may be used by other
drivers etc. that use extended memory. It costs 6 bytes of conventional
memory per
handle. Although TR has about 30 default file names, you will
probably only use 
a CQ and a few default exchanges. If the small number of available
file handles  
becomes a problem the code can be rewritten.
Eventually, if I get time,
I'll change to using a single extended memory handle.
Internally SBDVP
has a limit of 40 audio file names set by the parameter MAXFILES.
This can trivially increased and the code recompiled if needed.
<p>
Every time you choose to record a function, the following steps are
taken.
<dl compact>
<dt>1.
<dd>If audio for the function exists, its extended memory handle is freed.
<dt>2.
<dd>A new extended memory handle is allocated with the maximum
amount of contiguous free extended memory. This allows the recording
to be as large as possible.
<dt>3.
<dd>When the recording is stopped by hitting escape, the extended
memory associated with the file is truncated to the length of
the recording.
</dl>
<p>
The audio data is written to your hard disk only when you unload
SBDVP using
<br>
SBDVP -u
<br>
The file name will be the file name used by TR when the audio was
recorded.
<p>
Neither SBDVP.EXE or the HIMEM.SYS driver does anything very clever,
so if
you make a lot of rerecordings, you can fragment your extended memory
space so that a recording cannot be as large as the amount of
free extended memory.
As an example, assume you have 4 functions recorded each
using 100Kbytes,
and you have 1 Megabyte of extended memory total. If you decide
to rerecord the second file, it will free up the block of 100Kbytes,
and then allocate the largest block of contiguous extended memory, which will
be the 600Kbytes at the top of extended memory. If the new recording
takes 100Kbytes, the memory will look like 100K for file 1, 100K free,
300K for files 3,4 and the new number 2, and finally 500K free.
The largest contiguous free block is now 500K. Continued random rerecording
will further fragment the extended memory. If this becomes a
problem, a work around is to exit TR, unload SBDVP using the
command SBDVP -U, and then rerun SBDVP using SBDVPCFG.DAT 
with the list of files you want.
<p><h1><a name="SECTION000150000000000000000">
14 Program internal operation</a>
</h1>
<p>
When the DVP is enabled in TR, it looks to see if DVPTSR is loaded
by examining the 0x60 interrupt address to see if the label
DVPTSR00 is in the eight bytes before the interrupt driver. SBDVP
also sets itself up this way so that TR will know that the DVP
interrupt is available. TR then queries the DVP driver to find
a shared memory area where it transfers file names and commands.
When you press function keys on TR that need to communicate
with the DVP, TR puts filenames and commands in the shared memory
area and generates interrupt 0x60. SBDVP installs an interrupt
routine that is called when TR generates interrupt 0x60. This
routine parses the commands from TR to see what to do.
<p>
SBDVP when first installed not only takes over interrupt 0x60,
but it also installs an interrupt routine that copies data
between extended memory and a buffer that is used by the
direct memory access chips that connect to the sound card.
<p>
If TR tells SBDVP to transmit CQF1.DVP, the following steps
are taken
<dl compact>
<dt>1.
<dd>TR executes interrupt(s) 0x60 with filename CQF1.DVP, and the
commands to transmit the audio
<dt>2.
<dd>The SBDVP interrupt 0x60 routine parses the commands and then
locates the extended memory area that contains the audio to be
sent. It communicates with the DMA controller and the sound card
to tell them to work together to transmit the audio in autoinitiate
mode. This means the DMA just sends the same buffer over
and over until it is told to stop. SBDVP copies
the first data from  extended memory to a conventional memory buffer,
tells the DMA to start transmitting the buffer to the sound card,
and tells the sound card to output the audio
and to interrupt after half the buffer is sent.
<dt>3.
<dd>When the sound card sends the interrupt, the half of the buffer
that has been sent is overwritten with new data that is
copied from extended memory, and the interrupt
controller is reset.
<dt>4.
<dd>When the audio is all sent the sound card is reset
</dl>
<p>
Recording is done similarly except that all the data directions
are reversed. Additionally, a note is made of any newly recorded
audio. When SBDVP is unloaded, using SBDVP -u,
any newly recorded data is copied to hard disk so that it can be
reloaded if desired. If the computer is shut off or crashes before
SBDVP is unloaded, any newly recorded data will be lost. If you want
to make sure that a recording is saved you must unload SBDVP and
then restart it with the appropriate SBDVPCFG.DAT file.

in this code since I don't have an SB16 to play with. However, that
should improve the audio quality. The SB16 can also support 16 bit
audio which would also improve the sound quality.

16 TR DEBUG testing</a>
</h1>
<p>
You can set up TR in debug mode to help test out your configuration.
Record messages for CQF1.DVP, CQECXHNG.DVP (sic), and QSL.DVP,
and include these names in your SBDVPCFG.DAT startup file.
Pick a contest like CQWW where DEBUG works in CW mode. Set up
you LOGCFG.DAT so that it runs in CW mode when you type TR DEBUG.
See the TR manual for details. Now set CW TONE = 0 (unless
you enjoy hearing both CW and voice at the same time), MODE = SSB,
and start TR DEBUG. With a standard cw exchange set, and CW speed
set to 99 wpm, the ssb rate is 900 to 1000 per hour on my computer
(I have smartdrv enabled; without smartdrv the rate is around 600 per hour).
The program sends CW and the voice memories at the same time.
This exercises the program a lot.
I have let it run over night and it has successfully ``worked''
over 10,000 Qs on my system.
