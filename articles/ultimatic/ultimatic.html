<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >A few years ago, my daughter Rebecca, KE7TEK, and I put together an Elecraft K2 kit.
A great resource for any rig is the users&#8217; email list; I subscribed to the Elecraft email
reflector<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ultimatic2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a> in
case we needed help or advice during construction.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >  Recently several people on the email list commented that the built-in cw keyers in commercial rigs are
iambic keyers &#8211; sometimes like the Elecraft rigs they give you the choice of Curtis mode A or Curtis mode
B,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ultimatic3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1002f2"></a> but
generally not the older ultimatic mode. Since the new Elecraft K3, like other software defined radios, has
downloadable firmware, the obvious, and cleanest, solution to this problem is to include a selectable

ultimatic mode in the keyer firmware. This will probably be included in the future, but what if you want
ultimatic mode now or want to use ultimatic mode with a rig which won&#8217;t be upgraded? You have two
choices: either you can use an external keyer that includes the ultimatic mode, for example the K1EL
keyers,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ultimatic4.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1003f3"></a>
or you can try to put together an adapter that will make the internal keyer act like an ultimatic keyer. The
advantage of the adapter is that you can use the rig&#8217;s front panel controls &#8211; the speed control and all of the
rig&#8217;s keyer memories are available. Rigs like the Elecraft K3 can transmit RTTY using the
paddle input (but not the external key line) so that this feature becomes available to ultimatic
users.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Ultimatic mode</h3>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >John Kaye&#8217;s, W6SRY, first ultimatic keyer design was published in QST in
1953.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ultimatic5.html#fn4x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f4"></a>
He used a single lever paddle in his original design. His next version
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ultimatic6.html#fn5x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2002f5"></a> used a
dual paddle and it is this keyer&#8217;s action that gives the ultimatic mode its name.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >  While the ultimatic keyer used a dual paddle, unlike iambic keyers closing both the left and
right paddles gave the same result as closing only the last one. For example, to send an x with
the ultimatic mode you could hold closed the dash paddle for the first dash, then add the dot
paddle for the middle two dots, releasing just the dot paddle then gives the last dash. With
the ultimatic mode all letters except C can be made with one closure of the dot and/or dash
paddles. Iambic keyers can make a C with a single squeeze, but need more than one closure for X
and P. An ultimatic keyer can make a question mark, comma, and double dash, <span class="overline"><span 
class="cmmi-12">BT</span></span>, with one
closure, while an iambic keyer can make periods, semicolons and <span class="overline"><span 
class="cmmi-12">AR</span></span>, <span class="overline"><span 
class="cmmi-12">SK</span></span> and <span class="overline"><span 
class="cmmi-12">AA</span></span> with one
closure.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >  After learning about the ultimatic mode, I thought it would be fun to try to come up with a circuit that
would allow a standard iambic keyer to function like the ultimatic. Since you can build a whole keyer from a
microcontroller, you can obviously use a microcontroller to do the job. However, this has the disadvantage
that builders need to have a programmer for the microcontroller. The big advantage is that one

small low power chip is all you need. An alternative is to use standard logic gates since the
logic needed is rather simple. I was able to come up with a circuit that uses 6 NOR gates and
an inverter, so two quad NOR gate chips will also work. In this article I will describe both
routes.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >  A pair of quad NOR gates costs less than a dollar, so the adapter is inexpensive to build. Any
microcontroller has more than enough power for this job, and the simplest ones also cost a dollar or less
while the one I used in the end is around two dollars. Unless the adapter is built into the rig, connectors
and the enclosure will cost more than the electronic parts.
<!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >  Part of the fun of the design is working out the necessary logic. Here the design is practically a text-book
example. If you just want to try out the circuit, then you can skip the logic design and just look at section <a 
href="#x1-50005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec.nor --></a>
or section <a 
href="#x1-60006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec.micro --></a> for the prototype circuits. Just remember that you must have a PIC programmer to use the
PIC microprocessor circuit.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Logic Design</h3>
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Since closing the paddle grounds the input, I represent an open paddle as a 1 and a closed paddle as a 0 so
that ground potential is a 0. I want to drive the keyer through isolating transistors which will invert the
outputs. It makes sense to take the case where the output is on (i.e. the key line closed) as a 1 and the
output off as a 0.
<!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >  Since I use my left hand to operate paddles (I operate a bug right handed) but I have the paddles wired
for right-handed use, it gets too confusing to talk about dot and dash inputs and outputs. Instead I will
simply call them left and right inputs and outputs.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >  I write the left and right paddle inputs as <span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub> and <span

<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >State 1 has both paddles open and neither key line keyed. States 2 and 3 have either just the left or just the
right paddle closed and the corresponding key line is keyed. Finally States 4 and 5 have both paddles closed.
They key the line corresponding to the last paddle closed.

<!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >  The next step is to write what is called the transition state table. This is just a fancy name for
writing the logic above in a tabular form for easier analysis. The adapter is in one of its 5 states
when the input changes. The transition state table then gives the new state and outputs as
shown in table <a 
href="#x1-80031">1<!--tex4ht:ref: t1 --></a>. Each row corresponds to a current state given by the first entry. The other
entries in the row correspond to the 4 possible inputs, and give the resulting state and the
outputs. For example if we are in state 3, that is, the left paddle is closed and the right is open,
and we close the right paddle. The input is now 0,0, and we will change to state 5 and the
outputs are (<span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">out</span></sub> = 0, <span 
class="cmmi-12">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">out</span></sub>=1), so the entry corresponding to state 3 and inputs 0,0 is 5 (0,1).
Notice that there is a &#8220;<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">-</span>&#8221; for state 1 with the input 1,1. That is because this corresponds to
both paddles closing simultaneously and should never occur, so we don&#8217;t care what the adapter
does.
<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >  We could produce a circuit to make our transition state table, but it would be more complicated than
necessary. In fact, one reason to write the transition state table is to be able to see unnecessary
redundancies. In table <a 
href="#x1-80031">1<!--tex4ht:ref: t1 --></a> rows 2 and 4 are identical and rows 3 and 5 are identical. Because the transitions
from states 2 and 4 are identical, we don&#8217;t need to consider these as different states and can combine them
into a single state. Similarly we can combine states 3 and 5 to make a single state. Row 1 has a dash in the
last column and is identical to the other states everywhere else. It can be combined with either of the other
two. (This in fact says that if we did somehow manage to close the paddles simultaneously, our
choice here says it is like closing one before the other and our choice specifies which one we
take to have closed first.) I choose to combine it with 2 and 4, the old states 1,2, and 4 then
become new state 0, and the old states 3 and 5 become new state 1. Rewriting the transition
state table using these new states gives table <a 
href="#x1-80042">2<!--tex4ht:ref: t2 --></a>. This table is simpler and will give a simpler
circuit.
<!--l. 188--><p class="indent" >  Calling the state <span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span>, the truth table for the transition state table is shown in table <a 
href="#x1-80053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: t3 --></a>. The truth table is
constructed by writing for each current state value <span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">now</span></sub>, and input values <span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub>, <span 
class="cmmi-12">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub>, the corresponding new
state <span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">next</span></sub> and the output values <span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">out</span></sub>, <span 
class="cmmi-12">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">out</span></sub>. For example from our reduced transition state table we see
that if both paddles are closed <span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub> = <span 
class="cmmi-12">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub> = 0, and the state <span 
class="cmmi-12">S </span>= 0, we keep <span 
class="cmmi-12">S </span>= 0 and and the outputs are
<span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">out</span></sub> = 1, <span 
class="cmmi-12">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">out</span></sub> = 0.
<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >  We now want to describe the truth table by a set of logic equations. Let&#8217;s try to figure out a logic
equation for <span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span>. If we look at the rows where the <span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">next</span></sub> values are 1 (i.e. true), they all have <span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub> = 0. In
addition, they have either <span 
class="cmmi-12">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub> = 1 or <span 
class="cmmi-12">S </span>= 1 or both. The logic is <span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">next</span></sub> is (NOT <span 
class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub>) AND either <span

class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub> OR
<span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span><sub><span

class="cmmi-12">L</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">in</span></sub> to indicate the NOT, AND is represented by the
dot <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&#x22C5;</span>, and OR by the plus sign +. The logic equation becomes <span

<!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >  Since I was just seeing if this would work and not trying to build a permanent adapter, I put the
circuit together on a prototyping board. I had some CD4001 integrated circuits in my junk box,
so I used those. My rather messy result is shown in figures <a

 id="x1-60006"></a>Microcontroller implementation</h3>

<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >I have a Microchip PICkit 2 programmer.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ultimatic8.html#fn7x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-6001f7"></a>
Since my shack computer runs linux, instead of Microchip&#8217;s software I use the open source
gputils<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ultimatic9.html#fn8x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">8</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-6002f8"></a>
for an assembler and linker. Microchip provides compilable source code that will operate the PICkit 2 on
Linux and Macintosh, and fully supported software for Windows. If you use Windows, you can simply use
Microchip&#8217;s software. Both Microchip&#8217;s tools and the open source tools use compatible source code and
produce the same hex output files used to program the microprocessors.
<!--l. 277--><p class="indent" >  Just about any of the PIC microprocessors can be used. I initially tried a PIC10F200, one of the most
basic PICs available. While it worked, I wanted the processor to sleep when it wasn&#8217;t busy. According to its
data sheet the PIC10F200 can take many milliseconds to wake up from sleep, and a wake up from sleep
is like a reset and starts the program at its beginning with the processor reset to its default
configuration. More powerful PICS can be programmed to wake up and continue processing the
instructions after the sleep instruction. To simplify the programming and make the adapter more
robust, I switched to one of these more powerful PIC microprocessors. The one I had in my
junk box was a PIC16F690. It has much more power, more peripherals and more memory.
These are all unused and wasted for this simple application; many pins of the PIC16F690 are
unused. The circuit diagram is shown in figure <a 
href="#x1-80116">6<!--tex4ht:ref: f6 --></a>, and the source code files are given in the
appendix.
<!--l. 296--><p class="indent" >  The PIC16F690-I/P costs a couple of dollars directly from Microchip, with similar prices from Mouser,
Digikey and other vendors. For this application you could use one of the 12F series 8-pin chips
which would be a little cheaper and significantly smaller. You would need to modify the source
code for the different chip or write your own from scratch &#8211; the program is very short and
simple.
<!--l. 304--><p class="indent" >  The main advantages of the PIC solution is having only one integrated circuit and on chip pull up
resistors for the paddle inputs. This can help if space at a premium, for example when building the adapter
inside a rig. A disadvantage is that the PIC has a clock oscillator, and this could produce rf interference,
especially if mounted inside the rig near the receiving circuitry. I built my circuits so that they would drive
transistors that would interface to the keyer input. My prototypes did not include rf bypass capacitors on
the input and output lines. Adding these would be a good idea. I would try bypassing with 0.001 <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x03BC;</span>F
monolithic capacitors, and of course the power supply line should be bypassed to keep from adding
noise.
<!--l. 317--><p class="indent" >  Since I had already done the logic design, I programmed the PICs to implement the truth table, table <a 
href="#x1-80053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: t3 --></a>.
The program has a variable for the state <span 
class="cmmi-12">S </span>which is initially set to zero and stored. The microprocessor then

loops continuously reading its inputs and forming an index running from 0 to 7 corresponding to the binary
number of the first three columns of table <a 
href="#x1-80053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: t3 --></a>. The table entry corresponding to the binary number from the
last three columns of table <a 
href="#x1-80053">3<!--tex4ht:ref: t3 --></a> is returned and used to set the outputs and the new state. The process
repeats.
<!--l. 327--><p class="indent" >  The PIC16F690 internal oscillator starts rapidly, so when the paddles inputs have not changed, the
microprocessor can be put to sleep, and set to awaken when the paddle inputs change. Since the
microprocessor clock does not run when it is sleeping, power consumption and rf interference should not be
a major problem.
<!--l. 334--><p class="indent" >  The PIC only needs to have isolating transistors on its output lines. The input lines are
programmed to have internal pull-up resistors. Again, I used a couple of 2N3904 transistors with base
current limiting resistors that I had on hand. The resistors could be eliminated and current
consumption reduced by changing these to 2N7000 FETs. If you know that the keyer input voltages
and currents are within specifications, it would be easy to modify the source code to use the
PIC&#8217;s tri-state I/O pins to change so a high impedance gives the keyer input line open case,
and then pull the keyer input lines low for the closed case. This would eliminate the interface

and the internal Keyer in the Elecraft K2. Both breadboarded circuits worked as expected on all three
keyers &#8211; turning them into ultimatic mode keyers.
<!--l. 363--><p class="indent" >  Both the NOR gate and PIC microprocessor solutions work well. If your present keyer only does iambic
modes, you want to try the ultimatic mode with your dual paddle, and don&#8217;t want to buy a new keyer, you
can breadboard either of these circuits in less than an hour. If you want to get started with
microprocessor programming, putting together and programming the PIC16F690 is an easy first
project.

<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >Shortly after I posted this article, John Crabtree, KC0G, sent me an email with several very useful
comments. He pointed out that the discrete ultimatic adapter can be realized with 6 nor gates rather than 7
by including an additional state in the analysis.

since the circuit is now completely symmetric between the left and right paddle inputs and

<!--l. 530--><p class="noindent" >I used 2N3904 transistors with base current limiting resistors. The base resistors can be any value that
sufficiently limits the current and saturates the transistors; use larger values than I did if you have them
available. As mentioned in the text, the resistors could be eliminated if 2N7000 field effect
transistors were used. I used a pair of CD4001 integrated circuits, but 74LS02 quad two-input
NOR gates (or any other integrated circuit family) could also be used. The CD4001 can use a
wide range of supply voltage; I powered this circuit from an adjustable power supply usually
set at <span 
class="cmmi-12">V</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">dd</span></sub> = 9 Volts. The input pull-up resistors can be any reasonably convenient value that
holds the input gates high. Using FET output transistors and larger valued pull-up resistors
would reduce the current consumption. Rf bypass capacitors should be included on all the
external connections in a permanent installation. The unused inputs on the CD4001 should be
grounded.
