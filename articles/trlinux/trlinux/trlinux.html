1 Dosemu and Freedos</A>
</H1>
You need to have Dosemu with Freedos installed. These are available from
<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://dosemu.org">http://dosemu.org</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
1.1 Installing</A>
</H2>
Download the stable release
and install it. I use the binary version of Freedos (currently beta 0.95)
and compile the source for dosemu (currently dosemu-1.2.2.tgz).
Follow the directions in the file INSTALL.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">
1.2 Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>
After installation edit the global configuration file
(/etc/dosemu/dosemu.conf by default). I added the following lines:

<P>
<PRE>
$_rdtsc = (on)
$_com3 = "/dev/ptyq1"
$_com4 = "/dev/ptyq2"
$_ports = " device /dev/lp0 fast range 0x378 0x37f"
$_ports = $_ports, " device /dev/null fast range 0x3f8 0x3ff"
$_ports = $_ports, " device /dev/null fast range 0x2f8 0x2ff"
</PRE>
The first line uses the pentium timer. I don't know if this is necessary,
but I never turned it off. The second two lines tell dosemu to
use the linux
pseudottys /dev/ptyq1 and /dev/ptyq2 as the com3 and com4
serial ports rather than
hardware serial ports. This will allow us to connect these fake serial
ports to linux applications like telnet or secure shell for packet or
networking. Note that no other application should be using the pseudottys
specified. The proper way to do this is to use system calls to open
/dev/ptmx to get a unique pseudotty. Here we just pick some pseudottys
and hope that no other application will use them.
The last three lines gives Dosemu permission to use
the port range range needed for direct hardware
serial and parallel port access so TRlog
can key through the serial or parallel port. Notice that it associates the
parallel
port with the linux device /dev/lp0, so if something else in linux
is using /dev/lp0, these ports will not be available.

<P>
My shack computer has two serial and one parallel port. I can tell
TRlog to use serial 1 or 2 or parallel 1 for keying, etc. Packet and
networking between computers running TR is done using the fake serial
ports 3 or 4.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00013000000000000000">
1.3 Running as root</A>
</H2>
For TRlog to have permission to have direct access to the parallel or
serial ports, unfortunately, Dosemu must be run as root. The safest
way to do this is to use visudo to edit the sudo configuration file.
My shack computer is called boltzmann, so to allow user w1aw to run
dosemu on boltzmann as root without typing a password, I add the lines
<PRE>
w1aw boltzmann=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/dosemu.bin
w1aw boltzmann=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/xdosemu
</PRE>
be sure to change w1aw, boltzmann, and the location of dosemu.bin and
xdosemu to the appropriate values for your set up.

<P>
I start dosemu under X windows with the command
<PRE>
sudo xdosemu
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
2 Packet with telnet</A>
</H1>
With the configuration I use, com1 under dos is connected to pseudotty
q1. With the shack computer connected to the internet (I have a dsl
line at home with a wireless network, so the shack computer is connected
whenever it is on.) After starting TRlog in the xdosemu window, with
TRlog's logcfg.dat having the lines:
<PRE>
PACKET PORT = SERIAL 3
EIGHT BIT PACKET PORT = TRUE
</PRE>
I open a shell and type:
<PRE>
stty icrnl erase '^h'  &lt; /dev/ttyq1
telnet n7us.net &lt; /dev/ttyq1 &gt; /dev/ttyq1
</PRE>
The first line tells the pseudotty to use control-h as the backspace
key and to add carriage-returns to the newlines.
The second line
connects the pseudotty to N7US's telnet cluster in Mesa, Arizona.
You should use a cluster close to you.
At this point I can use ctrl-b in TRlog to log in to the packet
cluster and receive spots.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
3 Connecting TRlog using linux networking</A>
</H1>
With the configuration I use, com4 under dos is connected to pseudotty
q2. Turning on the networking in TRlog with
<PRE>
MULTI PORT = SERIAL 4
</PRE>
I then open a shell on each computer and type
<PRE>
ssh recievecomputer "cat &lt; /dev/ttyq2" &gt; /dev/ttyq2
</PRE>
where receivecomputer is the name of the computer I want to send my data to
around the networking loop. 
Do the same on the other computers to complete the loop. I have assumed
that they all are using pseudotty q2. If not adjust the devices accordingly
when performing the ssh command. Notice that
this uses whatever hardware you have set up for networking under linux.
It will work with ethernet, wireless, parallel or serial port ip, ppp,
ieee1394, or whatever else you have. My set up uses ethernet and wireless.

<P>

4 Voice Keyers</A>
</H1>
sbdvp is available at
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf">http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf</A>
can integrate a sound card with TRlog. However, it only partially works
under Dosemu. Dosemu emulates to some extent a soundblaster. Run sbdvp
as under DOS. There are two main problems. First, sbdvp will <EM>not</EM>
record under Dosemu. You must record your files under linux before
loading them with sbdvp. Second, under Dosemu, the last half second or
so of audio is not played. Therefore you will need to make sure that
a little dead air is left at the end of the messages.

<P>
Most linux distribution come with the sox package
which contains frontends rec and play. For example, to record cqf2.dvp
in an sbdvp compatible format, use
<PRE>
rec -r12048 -c1 -fu -b -t raw cqf2.dvp
</PRE>
You can play the file under linux as
<PRE>
play -r12048 -c1 -fu -b -t raw cqf2.dvp
</PRE>
to see how it sounds.
The flags on these commands say to use a rate of 12048 Hz, one channel, i.e.
not stereo, use unsigned, data is in bytes, write raw data to file cqf2.dvp.

<P>
External voice keyers should work as under DOS if the corresponding
ports are set up correctly.
