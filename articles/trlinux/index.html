1 Introduction</A>
</H1>
These notes describe how I run TRlog using DOSEMU under linux. I have
borrowed freely from various people who have
posted suggestsions on the
<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://lists.contesting.com/mailman/listinfo/trlog">TRlog mailing list</A>.
In  particular posts by Tor, N4OGW, have been very helpful. All mistakes
are, of course, my own.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
2 Disclaimer</A>
</H1>
I have done only limited testing, and I don't
understand how DOSEMU or TRLog really work. If your
computer crashes, your hair falls out, or anything else bad happens to
you after following these directions, don't blame me! If, however, you
win the lottery, I am willing to share.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
3 DOSEMU and Freedos</A>
</H1>
You need to have DOSEMU with Freedos installed. These are available from
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://dosemu.org">http://dosemu.org</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
3.1 Installing</A>
</H2>
Download the stable release
and install it. I use the binary version of Freedos (currently beta 0.9 rc5)
and compile the source for DOSEMU (currently dosemu-1.2.2.tgz).
Follow the directions in the file INSTALL.

<P>
If you want to use your sound card as a voice keyer, please see
section <A HREF="#section.sbdvp">6.2</A> below on SBDVP where I describe how to
set up a version of DOSEMU available from cvs
which works better.  I recommend that, in any case, you first get the
stable version running before dealing with a
development version.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
3.2 Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>
After installation edit the global configuration file
(/etc/dosemu/dosemu.conf by default). I added the following lines:

<P>
<PRE>
$_rdtsc = (on)
$_com3 = "/dev/ptyq1"
$_com4 = "/dev/ptyq2"
$_ports = " device /dev/lp0 fast range 0x378 0x37f"
$_ports = $_ports, " device /dev/null fast range 0x3f8 0x3ff"
$_ports = $_ports, " device /dev/null fast range 0x2f8 0x2ff"
</PRE>
The first line uses the pentium timer. I don't know if this is necessary,
but Tor, N4OGW, recommended it, and
I never turned it off. The second two lines tell DOSEMU to
use the linux
pseudottys /dev/ptyq1 and /dev/ptyq2 as the com3 and com4
serial ports rather than
hardware serial ports. This will allow us to connect these fake serial
ports to linux applications like telnet or secure shell for packet or
networking. Note that no other application should be using the pseudottys
specified.  The newer way to do this is to use system calls to open
the unix98 device
/dev/ptmx to get a unique pseudotty. However, since DOSEMU doesn't do
this, the older method must be used. Here I just pick some BSD legacy
pseudottys
and hope that no other application will use them (however, since most
applications will use the /dev/ptmx method a collision is unlikely).
Note that these legacy
pseudo ttys may not be turned on by default with some distributed
2.6 kernels.  If that is
your case, you will need to recompile the kernel with legacy (BSD) PTY
support to be able to connect TRlog to other applications. If you just
want to use the hardware serial and parallel ports as in DOS you do not
need to use the pseudottys.

<P>
The last three lines gives DOSEMU permission to use
the port range range needed for direct hardware
serial and parallel port access so TRlog
can key through the serial or parallel port. Notice that it associates the
parallel
port with the linux device /dev/lp0, so if something else in linux
is using /dev/lp0, these ports will not be available.

<P>
My shack computer has two serial and one parallel port. I can tell
TRlog to use serial 1 or 2 or parallel 1 for keying, etc. Packet and
networking between computers running TR is done using the fake serial
ports 3 or 4.

<P>
I have not found it necessary, but adding the line
<PRE>
$_hogthreshold = (0)
</PRE>
will give DOSEMU more cpu power if there are timing issues.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
3.3 Running as root</A>
</H2>
For TRlog to have permission to have direct access to the parallel or
serial ports, unfortunately, DOSEMU must be run as root. 
I do this with sudo. First use visudo to edit the sudo configuration file.
My shack computer is called boltzmann, so to allow user w1aw to run
DOSEMU on boltzmann as root without typing a password, I add the lines
<PRE>
w1aw boltzmann=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/dosemu.bin
w1aw boltzmann=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/xdosemu
</PRE>
be sure to change w1aw, boltzmann, and the location of dosemu.bin and
xdosemu to the appropriate values for your set up.

<P>
I start DOSEMU under X windows with the command
<PRE>
sudo xdosemu
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
4 Packet with telnet</A>
</H1>
With the configuration I use, com3 under dos is connected to pseudotty
q1. With the shack computer connected to the internet (I have a dsl
line at home with a wireless network, so the shack computer is connected
whenever it is on.) After starting TRlog in the xdosemu window, with
TRlog's logcfg.dat having the lines:
<PRE>
PACKET PORT = SERIAL 3
EIGHT BIT PACKET PORT = TRUE
</PRE>
I open a shell and type:
<PRE>
stty icrnl erase '^h'  &lt; /dev/ttyq1
telnet n7us.net &lt; /dev/ttyq1 &gt; /dev/ttyq1
</PRE>
The first line tells the pseudotty to use control-h as the backspace
key and to add carriage-returns to the newlines.
The second line
connects the pseudotty to N7US's telnet cluster in Mesa, Arizona.
You should use a cluster close to you.
At this point I can use ctrl-b in TRlog to log in to the packet
cluster and receive spots.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
5 Connecting TRlog using linux networking</A>
</H1>
With the configuration I use, com4 under dos is connected to pseudotty
q2. Turning on the networking in TRlog with
<PRE>
MULTI PORT = SERIAL 4
</PRE>
I then open a shell on each computer and type
<PRE>
ssh receivecomputer "cat &lt; /dev/ttyq2" &gt; /dev/ttyq2
</PRE>
where receivecomputer is the name of the computer I want to send my data to
around the networking loop. 
Do the same on the other computers to complete the loop. I have assumed
that they all are using pseudotty q2. If not adjust the devices accordingly
when performing the ssh command. Notice that
this uses whatever hardware you have set up for networking under linux.
It will work with ethernet, wireless, parallel or serial port ip, ppp,
ieee1394, or whatever else you have. My set up uses ethernet and wireless.

6 Voice Keyers</A>
</H1>
External voice keyers should work as under DOS if the corresponding
ports are set up correctly.

<P>
SBDVP, which is available at
<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf">http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf</A>,
can integrate a sound card with TRlog. However, it only partially works
under DOSEMU 1.2.2 without changes.
DOSEMU emulates to some extent a soundblaster. Run SBDVP
as under DOS.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">
6.1 SBDVP problems</A>
</H2>
There are two main problems with DOSEMU 1.2.2.
First, SBDVP will <EM>not</EM>
record under DOSEMU 1.2.2.
You can work around this by recording your files under linux before
loading them with SBDVP. Second, under DOSEMU 1.2.2, the last half second or
so of audio is not played. You can work around this by adding
a little dead air at the end of the messages.
In addition, occasionally, small amount of audio is skipped.

<P>
Most linux distribution come with the sox package
which contains frontends rec and play. For example, to record cqf2.dvp
in an SBDVP compatible format, use
<PRE>
rec -r12048 -c1 -fu -b -t raw cqf2.dvp
</PRE>
You can play the file under linux as
<PRE>
play -r12048 -c1 -fu -b -t raw cqf2.dvp
</PRE>
to see how it sounds.
The flags on these commands say to use a rate of 12048 Hz, one channel, i.e.
not stereo, use unsigned, data is in bytes, write raw data to file cqf2.dvp.

<P>

6.2 SBDVP solutions
</H2>
If working around the problems described above is too annoying,
you can make SBDVP work properly by getting the source for the
developer version of
DOSEMU from CVS. Since the current CVS version is the bleeding edge,
and changes often,
it sometimes has bugs. A version that works well for me is from
December 1, 2004 19:00 GMT. You can obtain this by typing
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dosemu login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dosemu \
checkout -D "December 1, 2004 19:00 GMT" dosemu
</PRE>
just hit return when prompted for the login password. You can leave
out the backslash at the end of the line if you type the second cvs
command as one long line. Follow the CVS Tree
link at
<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://dosemu.org">http://dosemu.org</A>.
for more information. This CVS version can record within TR at 8000Hz
and does not have the play back problem.
Compile and install as before.

<P>
With this version of DOSEMU, SBDVP will record and will play.
However since recording currently only works at 8000Hz, SBDVP should be
started with its rate set to 8000Hz,
<PRE>
sbdvp -r8000
</PRE>
If you test with the file cqf10.dvp distributed with SBDVP, Hal's voice
will be rather low pitched and slow since it was recorded at the 12048
rate. Files recorded within SBDVP will use the 8000 Hz rate.

<P>
<EM>Note: In my limited testing, occasionally a bit of audio is still
skipped.</EM>

<P>
If you want to prepare or listen to files under linux,
use 8000 instead of 12048 in the play and record commands shown above.

<P>

7 Window Managers</A>
</H1>
Many window managers use various control and alt function key combinations
for ``hot keys'' to move, resize etc. windows. If you run under X as I 
do, these may not allow those combinations to get to TRlog. The simplest
solution is to turn off these hot keys when using DOSEMU and TRlog.
All window managers have some method of customizing these hot keys.
Check your window manager documentation.
