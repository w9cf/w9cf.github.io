5 The effectiveness of a balun</A>
</H1>
<P>
Let me analyze a simple case of a perfect quarter wave balanced line
with a 300 ohm characteristic impedance terminated in a 50 ohm
resistor. The line goes vertically straight up and the ground is
assumed perfectly conducting.  The reason for all of these assumptions
is so I can make simple estimates of what the impedances are. The situation
I am modeling is the case where the input to the feedline has
a small common mode impedance, and a large differential mode impedance.
<P>
<!-- MATH: Z_D =  300^2/50 -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB> = 300<SUP>2</SUP>/50  or 1800 ohms resistive.  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  will be the impedance of
a quarter wave vertical driven against ground or about 35 ohms resistive.
 <I>Z</I><SUB>1</SUB>  =  <I>Z</I><SUB>2</SUB>  = 900 ohms,  <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB>  = -415 ohms, where the labeling is
given in figure <A HREF="node3.html#f4">4</A>.
<P>
Now lets hook up our ferrite bead balun by connecting the
shield of the coax to terminal 2 and the center conductor to 1.
A large ferrite bead balun will introduce an impedance of around

<!-- MATH: |Z_{Bal}| = 6000 -->
 |<I>Z</I><SUB>Bal</SUB>| = 6000  ohms from point 2 to ground.  (Walter Maxwell's March
1983 QST article gives these values,
he measured about 6000 ohms with both R and X
around 4000 at 4MHz for a bead balun made from 300 #73 beads).  Again,
to simplify things I'll just assume the balun is resistive and has a
resistance of 4000 ohms.  The circuit looks like a driving voltage
across 
<!-- MATH: Z_1 +(Z_2 ~~ ||~~ (Z_{Balun}+Z_3)) -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>1</SUB> + (<I>Z</I><SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;||&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB>)) , where  ||  means take the

parallel combination. This is shown in figure <A HREF="node6.html#f8">8</A>.
<P>
The impedance is 
<!-- MATH: Z_D/2+(Z_{Balun}+Z_C-Z_D/4)Z_D/(2 (Z_{Balun}+Z_C+Z_D/4)) -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/2 + (<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> - <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/4)<I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/(2(<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/4)) . For the
balun to work well the second term should also contribute  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/2 , so
I want 
<!-- MATH: (Z_{Balun}+Z_C-Z_D/4)/(Z_{Balun}+Z_C+Z_D/4) -->
 (<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> - <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/4)/(<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/4)  to be close to one.
That is I want

<!-- MATH: Z_{Balun}+Z_C -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  to be much larger than  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/2 . Checking this case,

<!-- MATH: Z_{Balun}+Z_C -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  is about
4000 ohms, and  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/2  is 900 ohms, so the second term is about 80 percent
of the first. That means for 1 volt across the terminals, there will be
approximately 1/2 volt across the ferrite.  The relative dissipation in
the balun is therefore 
<!-- MATH: 1800/(4\times 4000) -->
 1800/(4 <TT>x</TT> 4000)  or 11 percent. At 1500 watts
output that's about 170 watts dissipated in the balun which may be more
than it can take.  A smaller balun with only a 1000 ohm impedance will
be worse.
<P>
Another example is to simply take an 1800 ohm 1/2 watt resistor and
hook it to your balun. Since the resistor has a very large common mode
impedance, you would have  <I>Z</I><SUB>1</SUB> = <I>Z</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 900 and  <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB>  a very large value.  The
balun is now in series with  <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB> , and since  <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB>  is very large, even
though the differential mode impedance is identical, there is no
problem, in fact in this case, you don't even need a balun since
shorting 2 to ground still doesn't allow any substantial common
mode current flow.
<P>
Now let's see what happens if a balanced tuner is added to the first
case. Picking a balanced L network to transform to 50 ohms I can use a
parallel capacitor of 304 ohms across terminals 1 and 2 as
in figure <A HREF="node6.html#f9">9</A> which has the equivalent circuit shown in
figure <A HREF="node6.html#f10">10</A>.

A pair of
series inductors of 148 ohms from terminal 1 to a new terminal 1' and
from 2 to a new terminal 2' will cancel the differential mode
capacitive reactance and when the W2DU balun is attached
the equivalent circuit is shown in figure <A HREF="node6.html#f11">11</A>.

<P>
The new differential mode impedance is 50
ohms. The new common mode impedance is the old value plus the impedance
of the two parallel inductors = 35 +j 74 ohms.
<P>
Clearly the balun will work exceptionally well now. For 1 volt across
1' and 2', the power into the load will be 1/50 watt. The power into
our balun will be roughly 
<!-- MATH: 1/(4 Z_{Balun}) -->
 1/(4<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>)  which will be about 1 percent of the
of the power for a 1000 ohm balun and 4 times less for the 4000 ohm
balun.  1500 watts input gives 5 to 20 watts dissipated which I think a bead
balun can easily stand. So changing from an unbalanced tuner with a
balun on either the input or output to a balanced tuner with the balun
on the input can really help. An advantage a substantially resistive
balun like a ferrite balun is that there is no danger of cancellation in
the 
<!-- MATH: Z_{Balun}+Z_C -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  term since the resistive parts of both must be positive.
<P>
The idea that an unbalanced tuner will transform the differential
mode impedance to 50 ohms is correct. Why is it that it doesn't help
in reducing the common mode currents? I have already shown that moving
the balun to the input can't help matters. Let's see what happens
to the equivalent circuit when an unbalanced tuner is added. An unbalanced
L network would include a single series inductor rather than the
two that I used above. Adding this single series inductor to
the circuit of figure <A HREF="node6.html#f11">11</A> gives the circuit shown in
figure <A HREF="node6.html#f12">12</A>.

Notice that for the differential mode impedance is 50 ohms, but there
is now a 148 ohm reactance that must be included in the unbalancing
impedance  <I>Z</I><SUB>U</SUB>  of figure <A HREF="node3.html#f4">4</A>. The balun impedance must also
be much larger than this impedance to be effective. An unbalanced tuner
trades the large differential mode impedance for a large unbalanced
impedance making the balun's job unchanged. I can calculate the approximate
dissipation in our balun of figure <A HREF="node6.html#f12">12</A>. If I (correctly)
assume that the balun current is low compared to the current through
the 25 ohm load resistors, the power dissipated in the resistors
will be  |<I>I</I>|<SUP>2</SUP>50  where  <I>I</I>  is the current through the resistors.
Since the balun impedance is large, I can ignore the 74 ohm inductive
reactance and the 22.5 ohm common mode resistance. The magnitude of the
voltage
across the balun in then approximately 
<!-- MATH: |I|\sqrt{25^2+148^2} -->
 |<I>I</I>|<IMG WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.gif"
 ALT="$\sqrt{25^2+148^2}$"> , and
the power dissipated in the balun divided by the power dissipated in the
load is 
<!-- MATH: (25^2+148^2)/(50 \times 4000) -->
 (25<SUP>2</SUP> + 148<SUP>2</SUP>)/(50 <TT>x</TT> 4000)  or 11 percent just as before
I added the tuner. Notice that 
<!-- MATH: 4(25^2+148^2)/50 = 1800 -->
 4(25<SUP>2</SUP> + 148<SUP>2</SUP>)/50 = 1800 ; this
is simply the design equation used to calculate the L-network that
transforms an 1800 ohm resistance to 50 ohms.
<P>
The result is that if you have a well balanced load, using
a balanced tuner before the balun can be very helpful.
