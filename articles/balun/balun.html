1 Introduction</A>
</H1>
Commercial antenna tuners use unbalanced circuits such a Pi-, T-, or
L-network to match unbalanced loads to 50 ohms for our transmitters.
A simple way to include the capability to handle
balanced loads is to include a balun somewhere
in the circuit.
Johnson Matchbox tuners, which are no longer produced, but
can sometimes be found at hamfests, have a balanced output
circuit and a link coupled input to make the transformation
from the unbalanced input to a balanced output. Some
hams still build tuners this way too.
<P>
Since a simple multiband antenna is a center fed wire fed
with twinlead or windowline to an antenna tuner,
a beginning ham (and even
some old timers) can wonder what is the best or at least a
good way of handling the two jobs of impedance matching and
changing from twinlead or windowline from the antenna
to coax at the transmitter.
<P>
Typical solutions are summarized as:
<UL>
<LI>
Use a balun to connect from the twinlead to an unbalanced tuner.
That is use a balun on the output of an unbalanced tuner as shown
in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f1">1</A>.
<LI>
Connect a balun to the input of an unbalanced tuner and ``float''
the tuner. The output of the tuner is connected to the twinlead; one
side of the twinlead goes to the center conductor of the unbalanced
output connector and the other to the case of the tuner.
That is, use a balun at the input of an unbalanced tuner as shown
in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f2">2</A>.
<LI>
Use a balanced tuner configuration to convert the twinlead impedance
to 50 ohms balanced and then use a 1:1 balun to convert to 50
ohms unbalanced. That is, use a balun on the input of a balanced
tuner as shown in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f3">3</A>.

In all of the following, I will assume that the balun is a 1:1
choke or current type. Examples are the ferrite bead balun
described by Walter Maxwell, W2DU[<A
 HREF="balun.html#maxwell83">1</A>], coiled up coax,
and coax or a bifilar winding through a toroidal core.
A nonradiating balanced transmission line requires that the current
in the two conductors be the same. If, for example,
the balanced line is poorly routed, the currents in the two wires 
can become different because of unequal coupling to their surroundings.
Even so, to minimize transmission line radiation near the
transmitter (and operator) the currents in the two wires should still be
equalized at the transmitter. Again, this tells us that the best choice
will be a choke or current balun.

2 A two wire transmission line as a three terminal Device</A>
</H1>
<P>
Commercial transmitters have unbalanced outputs. That is
the output is taken between the output connectors center conductor
and the transmitter case. I will call the transmitter case ground.
That is, whenever an impedance is measured between a point in
the circuit and ground, it means that the point is close to the
transmitter case, and the impedance is measured between that point
and the transmitter case.
<P>
The two wires
of our balanced transmission line are two connections with some
impedance across them from the antenna. In addition, the lines
will have an impedance to ground. For example a quarter
wave length of twinlead, both wires connected together and driven
against ground will would look like a quarter wave monopole.
If the antenna is not well balanced or if one of the transmission
line  wires runs close to another conductor, the line can be
unbalanced to some extent. That means that the impedance measured
between one of the lines and ground is not the same as between
the other line and ground. A general two-wire transmission line
ending up near our transmitter can be represented as a T equivalent
circuit as shown in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f4">4</A>. If I put a current into
one wire of the transmission line and remove it from the other,
this is the differential mode of the line. The resulting impedance
I will call  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>  or the differential mode impedance. If I connect
both wires together, and drive them against ground, I call
the resulting impedance the common mode impedance  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> . Finally, if the
impedance from each wire to ground is not the same, this is unbalance
which I'll represent as  <I>Z</I><SUB>U</SUB> . The labeling in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f4">4</A> shows
how these impedances relate to the three impedances of the T equivalent
circuit. Notice if the twinlead is well balanced that  <I>Z</I><SUB>U</SUB> = 0 ,

As you can see the system is not well balanced at all
The method of measuring these impedances is described in the
appendix. I highly recommend making some measurements
to better determine the best solution to match the feedline impedance.

3 The W2DU and W7EL models of a choke balun</A>
</H1>
<P>
I now have a circuit equivalent of our antenna and transmission line.
Since the circuit for tuners is well known, this leaves only the
equivalent circuit for a choke balun to allow us to analyze
our tuner-balun-antenna sytem using standard circuit theory.
<P>
Two useful and equivalent models of a choke balun are those
described by Walter Maxwell, W2DU and Roy Lewallen, W7EL. 
In Maxwell's model, of a choke balun, he uses the fact that
the coax shield is many skin depths thick so that it shields
the outside from fields on the inside of the coax.
The only place the fields can
escape is therefore at the end where the coax is connected
to a balun or to some other load. A well shielded transmitter
driving one end of the coax therefore can only produce external
fields
at the other end of the coax. You can think of the transmitter as
producing a voltage across the points where the center
conductor and the shield of the coax attach. At this point,
the internal fields escape, and can cause
currents to flow on the outside of the outer conductor of the
coax.
<P>
The equivalent setup is is shown in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f5">5</A>. The transmitter
applies a voltage between the inner and outer conductors
of the coax, and the outside of the outer conductor of the coax
is then another part of the system.  If I use no balun, and simply
connect our coax to the twinlead, center conductor to terminal 1 and
shield to terminal 2, the transmitter applies a voltage
across terminals 1 and 2 in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f4">4</A>. The outside of the outer
conductor presents an impedance 
<!-- MATH: Z_{\rm Shield} -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Shield</SUB> 
back to the case of the transmitter
which I have taken to be terminal 3. That means that this impedance is
placed from terminal 2 to 3 as shown in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f5">5</A>.

<P>
A choke balun made by coiling up coax would change the impedance
of the outside of the coax shield to the inductive reactance of the
coil. A choke balun made from ferrite beads slipped over the outside
of the coax will also increase this impedance. In his July 1983 QST
article 
Maxwell gave measurements of about  15.6 + <I>j</I>13.1  ohms per bead at 4 MHz
for #73 beads.
(However, I recently bought a bead balun kit at a hamfest which claimed to be
50 #73 beads. My balun measured  660 + <I>j</I>438  ohms or  13 + <I>j</I>9  ohms
per bead 4 MHz. Apparently, all beads are not created equal, and
it is prudent to make a few measurements to see how many beads
are needed to make a good balun with your materials.)
Adding this impedance in series with 
<!-- MATH: Z_{\rm Shield} -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Shield</SUB>  gives
the balun common mode impedance  <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>  and 
the circuit shown in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f6">6</A>. Since there is only a single
connection to ground, I have dropped this connection to simplify the
circuit diagram. Notice that  <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>  is
connected in series with  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  so it effectively just increases  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> .

<P>
Maxwell's analysis gives a simple rule for understanding a choke
balun connected to the three terminal network given by our twinlead
fed antenna. Simply connect the balun common mode impedance from
the terminal 2 to 3, and drive the antenna across terminals 1 and
2. If the current through terminal 3 is made small enough by
the balun impedance, then the drive current is balanced between
terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
Roy Lewallen, W7EL, has given model of a choke balun by using
an ideal transformer as shown in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f7">7</A>.
The connection shown is schematically the same
as that normally drawn for a bifilar wound choke balun.
A real balun is not an ideal
transformer (nothing is), so the impedance  <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>  is added.
The ideal transformer performs exactly the same task as the
independent generator in the W2DU model.
The W7EL model is equivalent to W2DU's
model. The advantage is that you can write down a complete equivalent
circuit for the tuner, balun, and antenna immediately without
applying Maxwell's rules.

4 Baluns on the input and output of unbalanced tuners</A>
</H1>
<P>
Roy, W7EL,  worked out the math for moving a current balun from output
to input of an unbalanced tuner using his model of a choke
balun and found that essentially nothing
changed.[<A
 HREF="balun.html#lewallen">2</A>] I'll look at a particular case later, but it
is easy to see this result using the W2DU model of
a choke balun.
<P>
Assume a transmitter
is connected with a short length of coax to a well shielded unbalanced
tuner which is connected to another short piece of coax to our
twinlead. 
Also assume that while the transmitter may be grounded, that the
rest of this does not have additional connections.
<P>
Since the shield is continuous from the transmitter around
the tuner to the end of the output coax, I can apply the same
analysis as Walter Maxwell did and what happens inside the tuner
and coax is immaterial for what happens outside.  Changing the
tuner adjustment will change the impedance the transmitter sees,
but it does nothing
else. In any case, assume that the tuner is always adjusted so
the transmitter sees a 50 ohm load.
<P>
Now replace the output coax jumper with a 1:1 current balun
at the output of the tuner. W2DU's model tells us to replace
the inner conductor with a generator across the balun output,
and an additional impedance from the choke in series with the shield
impedance back to the transmitter.
<P>
Move the balun to the coax at the input to the tuner, and analyze the
system. In this case, because the tuner is also shielded, the generator
that W2DU tells us should be at the tuner input can be moved (with a different
source impedance) to
the tuner output. In that case all that has changed is the position
of the choke.
<P>
The only difference between these situations is
that we have moved the choke balun to a slightly different point on a
feedline. If you built a tuner so that it was a cylinder a foot long
with the same outside diameter as RG-8, with the input on one end and
the output on the other, you could move the balun from input to output
by simply sliding the your ferrite beads along the &quot;feedline&quot; by a foot
or so.  If you use a air wound coild, you would simply move the coil
one foot along the feedline. This really can't do anything
useful unless the tuner is poorly constructed. In that
case fixing the tuner would be more useful. The one difference that
you might see in the two cases would be if the tuner case itself had
substantial self capacitance or if it had capacitance back to the
transmitter case. In the latter case, a balun at the input of the
tuner could be ``short-circuited'' by the tuner-transmitter case capacitance.
This might happen if both rested close to a large metal desk or shelves.
The tuner case self capacitance is easily estimated. A rough estimate
is to take the largest dimension of the case in centimeters, divide
this by 2 and you have a rough estimate of the self capacitance of
the cabinet in picofarads. For a cabinet of 30 cm on a side this would
give 15 pF, or about 3000 ohms at 80 meters - probably not low enough to
worry too much about, but the most sensible place to put a balun
is on an unbalanced tuner's output, like it is on nearly all commercial
tuners, and not on its input.
<P>
Notice that the above says
nothing about the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of the balun.
It simply says it is essentially
equally effective or ineffective on the input and
output sides of an unbalanced tuner.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
5 The effectiveness of a balun</A>

<P>
Let me analyze a simple case of a perfect quarter wave balanced line
with a 300 ohm characteristic impedance terminated in a 50 ohm
resistor. The line goes vertically straight up and the ground is
assumed perfectly conducting.  The reason for all of these assumptions
is so I can make simple estimates of what the impedances are. The situation
I am modeling is the case where the input to the feedline has
a small common mode impedance, and a large differential mode impedance.
<P>
<!-- MATH: Z_D =  300^2/50 -->

<P>
Now lets hook up our ferrite bead balun by connecting the
shield of the coax to terminal 2 and the center conductor to 1.
A large ferrite bead balun will introduce an impedance of around

 |<I>Z</I><SUB>Bal</SUB>| = 6000  ohms from point 2 to ground.  (Walter Maxwell's March

he measured about 6000 ohms with both R and X
around 4000 at 4MHz for a bead balun made from 300 #73 beads).  Again,
to simplify things I'll just assume the balun is resistive and has a
resistance of 4000 ohms.  The circuit looks like a driving voltage

That is I want

<!-- MATH: Z_{Balun}+Z_C -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  to be much larger than  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/2 . Checking this case,

<!-- MATH: Z_{Balun}+Z_C -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  is about
4000 ohms, and  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB>/2  is 900 ohms, so the second term is about 80 percent
of the first. That means for 1 volt across the terminals, there will be
approximately 1/2 volt across the ferrite.  The relative dissipation in
the balun is therefore 
<!-- MATH: 1800/(4\times 4000) -->
 1800/(4 <TT>x</TT> 4000)  or 11 percent. At 1500 watts
output that's about 170 watts dissipated in the balun which may be more
than it can take.  A smaller balun with only a 1000 ohm impedance will
be worse.
<P>
Another example is to simply take an 1800 ohm 1/2 watt resistor and
hook it to your balun. Since the resistor has a very large common mode
impedance, you would have  <I>Z</I><SUB>1</SUB> = <I>Z</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 900 and  <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB>  a very large value.  The
balun is now in series with  <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB> , and since  <I>Z</I><SUB>3</SUB>  is very large, even
though the differential mode impedance is identical, there is no
problem, in fact in this case, you don't even need a balun since
shorting 2 to ground still doesn't allow any substantial common
mode current flow.
<P>
Now let's see what happens if a balanced tuner is added to the first
case. Picking a balanced L network to transform to 50 ohms I can use a
parallel capacitor of 304 ohms across terminals 1 and 2 as
in figure <A HREF="balun.html#f9">9</A> which has the equivalent circuit shown in
figure <A HREF="balun.html#f10">10</A>.

<P>
The new differential mode impedance is 50
ohms. The new common mode impedance is the old value plus the impedance
of the two parallel inductors = 35 +j 74 ohms.
<P>
Clearly the balun will work exceptionally well now. For a voltage V across
1' and 2', the power into the load will be approximately
 |<I>V</I>|<SUP>2</SUP>/50 . The power into
our balun will be roughly 
<!-- MATH: |V|^2/(4 Z_{Balun}) -->
 |<I>V</I>|<SUP>2</SUP>/(4<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>) . The ratio is 
<!-- MATH: 12.5/Z_{Balun} -->
 12.5/<I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> 
or about 1 percent of the
of the power for a 1000 ohm balun and 4 times less for the 4000 ohm
balun.  1500 watts input gives 5 to 20 watts dissipated which I think a bead
balun can easily stand. So changing from an unbalanced tuner with a
balun on either the input or output to a balanced tuner with the balun
on the input can really help. An advantage a substantially resistive
balun like a ferrite balun is that there is no danger of cancellation in
the 
<!-- MATH: Z_{Balun}+Z_C -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB> + <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  term since the resistive parts of both must be positive.
<P>
The idea that an unbalanced tuner will transform the differential
mode impedance to 50 ohms is correct. Why is it that it doesn't help
in reducing the common mode currents? I have already shown that moving
the balun to the input can't help matters. Let's see what happens
to the equivalent circuit when an unbalanced tuner is added. An unbalanced
L network would include a single series inductor rather than the
two that I used above. Adding this single series inductor to
the circuit of figure <A HREF="balun.html#f11">11</A> gives the circuit shown in
figure <A HREF="balun.html#f12">12</A>.

Notice that for the differential mode impedance is 50 ohms, but there
is now a 148 ohm reactance that must be included in the unbalancing
impedance  <I>Z</I><SUB>U</SUB>  of figure <A HREF="balun.html#f4">4</A>. The balun impedance must also
be much larger than this impedance to be effective. An unbalanced tuner
trades the large differential mode impedance for a large unbalanced
impedance making the balun's job unchanged. I can calculate the approximate
dissipation in our balun of figure <A HREF="balun.html#f12">12</A>. If I (correctly)
assume that the balun current is low compared to the current through
the 25 ohm load resistors, the power dissipated in the resistors
will be  |<I>I</I>|<SUP>2</SUP>50  where  <I>I</I>  is the current through the resistors.
Since the balun impedance is large, I can ignore the 74 ohm inductive
reactance and the 22.5 ohm resistance. The magnitude of the
voltage
across the balun in then approximately 
<!-- MATH: |I|\sqrt{25^2+148^2} -->
 |<I>I</I>|<IMG WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.gif"
 ALT="$\sqrt{25^2+148^2}$"> , and
the power dissipated in the balun divided by the power dissipated in the
load is 
<!-- MATH: (25^2+148^2)/(50 \times 4000) -->
 (25<SUP>2</SUP> + 148<SUP>2</SUP>)/(50 <TT>x</TT> 4000)  or 11 percent just as before
I added the tuner. Notice that 
<!-- MATH: 4(25^2+148^2)/50 = 1800 -->
 4(25<SUP>2</SUP> + 148<SUP>2</SUP>)/50 = 1800 ; this
is simply the design equation used to calculate the L-network that
transforms an 1800 ohm resistance to 50 ohms.

6 Conclusion</A>
</H1>
<P>
The results described here are simple.
<UL>
<LI>
As noted by Roy Lewallen, W7EL,[<A
 HREF="balun.html#lewallen">2</A>]
putting a choke balun on the input of an unbalanced tuner to drive
a balanced line is useless. It introduces a ``hot'' tuner case
which must be isolated with no benefit over putting the balun
on the output.
<LI>
Well balanced loads with a high differential mode impedance and
a low common mode impedance can stress a balun connected to
the output of an unbalanced tuner.
<LI>
Methods that lower the differential mode impedance without upsetting
the balance of the load make the balun's job easier.
</UL>
<P>
Richard Measures, AG6K, described a balanced tuner with a balun on its
input in February 1990 QST[<A
 HREF="balun.html#measures">3</A>].
Since the balanced tuner transforms the diffential
mode impedance to 50 ohms, the tuner and balun combination will work well.
The extra cost of the balanced tuner is the main disadvantage.
<P>
For cases where a balun on the output of an unbalanced tuner is stressed,
a brute force solution would be to use a bigger balun.
In some cases this may be the most convenient
and least expensive solution. Doubling the size of a bead balun should double
its impedance which will cut the dissipation in half and doubling
the physical size of the balun makes it better able to dissipate heat.
<P>
Another possibility is to change the balanced
feedline length. Cecil Moore, W6RCA,
has advocated the use of this technique, and has developed methods to
switch in extra feedline to tune balanced loads. His methods are
described in detail on his Web page
<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="http://people.delphi.com/CecilMoore/index.html">http://people.delphi.com/CecilMoore/index.html</A>
.
One method is to add feedline so that a current maximum
is located at the balun connection. The differential mode feedpoint
impedance is resistive there and has a value of 
<!-- MATH: Z_0/{\rm SWR} -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>0</SUB>/<I>SWR</I>  where  <I>Z</I><SUB>0</SUB> 
is the characteristic impedance of the line, for example 300 ohms, and
SWR is the standing wave ratio on the line. Since this cannot be
greater than  <I>Z</I><SUB>0</SUB> , the balun will perform well.

7 Appendix: Measuring  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB> ,  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> , and  <I>Z</I><SUB>U</SUB> </A>
</H1>
<P>
To measure the differential  <I>Z</I><SUB>D</SUB> , common mode  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> , and
unbalanced  <I>Z</I><SUB>U</SUB>  impedances, you need an rf impedance measuring
instrument like an impedance bridge, noise bridge, vector voltmeter,
or network analyzer. For high frequency work I use an old General
Radio GR821A twin-T admittance measuring circuit. The main disadvantage
of using an old piece of gear like this is that it is slow. The main
advantage is that they can be found for very little money, and they measure
impedance from 0.4 to 40 MHz.
For these measurements, the case of the GR821A is the
``ground.'' I normally set it on the operating desk with a strap
to the same safety ground point that the transmitter connects to.
The GR821A measures admittance, and requires corrections to the
measured values as described in its manual. The GR821A easily
measures high impedances, but low impedance values
are often outside its range and require the use
of a series capacitor to bring the impedance into range. The impedance
of the capacitor can then be subtracted off. The inclusion of the
corrections, and conversion from admittance to impedance is conveniently
done using a programmable calculator or the shack computer.
I have written a web based applet that does this. It is available
at <A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf">http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf</A>
, and will run within any Java activated
web browser.
Many hams have noise bridges, and these can be used if they are
fairly accurate. To measure high impedances, they will generally require
the addition of a shunt capacitor to bring the impedance into the range
of the bridge. Again a programmable calculator or computer is
handy to do the needed calculations to get the correct impedance.
<P>
I measure  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  by connecting both leads
of the twinlead together and measuring the impedance to ground.
Next I connect wire 2 to ground and measure the impedance between
wire 1 and ground and call this  <I>Z</I><SUB>a</SUB> .  Reversing the connections,
by grounding wire 1 and measuring between wire 2 and ground gives
 <I>Z</I><SUB>b</SUB> .
<P>
A straightforward application of circuit theory gives the equations:
