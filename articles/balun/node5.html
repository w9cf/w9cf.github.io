4 Baluns on the input and output of unbalanced tuners</A>
</H1>
<P>
Roy, W7EL,  worked out the math for moving a current balun from output
to input of an unbalanced tuner using his model of a choke
balun and found that essentially nothing
changed.[<A
 HREF="node9.html#lewallen">2</A>] I'll look at a particular case later, but it
is easy to see this result using the W2DU model of
a choke balun.
<P>
Look at the equipment shown in figure <A HREF="node4.html#f6">6</A>. The transmitter
is connected with a short length of coax to a well shielded unbalanced
tuner which is connected to another short piece of coax to our
twinlead. 
Assume that while the transmitter may be grounded, that the
rest of this does not have additional connections.
<P>
Since the shield is continuous from the transmitter around
the tuner to the end of the output coax, I can apply the same
analysis as Walter Maxwell did and what happens inside the tuner
and coax is immaterial for what happens outside.  Changing the
tuner adjustment will change the impedance the transmitter sees,
but it does nothing
else. In any case, assume that the tuner is always adjusted so
the transmitter sees a 50 ohm load.
<P>
Now replace the output coax jumper with a 1:1 current balun
at the output of the tuner. W2DU's model tells us to replace
the inner conductor with a generator across the balun output,
and an additional impedance from the choke in series with the shield
impedance back to the transmitter.
<P>
Move the balun to the coax at the input to the tuner, and analyze the
system. In this case, because the tuner is also shielded, the generator
that W2DU tells us should be at the tuner input can be moved (with a different
source impedance) to
the tuner output. In that case all that has changed is the position
of the choke.
<P>
The only difference between these situations is
that we have moved the choke balun to a slightly different point on a
feedline. If you built a tuner so that it was a cylinder a foot long
with the same outside diameter as RG-8, with the input on one end and
the output on the other, you could move the balun from input to output
by simply sliding the your ferrite beads along the &quot;feedline&quot; by a foot
or so.  If you use a air wound coild, you would simply move the coil
one foot along the feedline. This really can't do anything
useful unless the tuner is poorly constructed. In that
case fixing the tuner would be more useful. The one difference that
you might see in the two cases would be if the tuner case itself had
substantial self capacitance or if it had capacitance back to the
transmitter case. In the latter case, a balun at the input of the
tuner could be ``short-circuited'' by the tuner-transmitter case capacitance.
This might happen if both rested close to a large metal desk or shelves.
The tuner case self capacitance is easily estimated. A rough estimate
is to take the largest dimension of the case in centimeters, divide
this by 2 and you have a rough estimate of the self capacitance of
the cabinet in picofarads. For a cabinet of 30 cm on a side this would
give 15 pF, or about 3000 ohms at 80 meters - probably not low enough to
worry too much about, but the most sensible place to put a balun
is on an unbalanced tuner's output, like it is on nearly all commercial
tuners, and not on its input.
<P>
Notice that the above says
nothing about the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of the balun.
It simply says it is essentially
equally effective or ineffective on the input and
output sides of an unbalanced tuner.
