3 The W2DU and W7EL models of a choke balun</A>
</H1>
<P>
I now have a circuit equivalent of our antenna and transmission line.
Since the circuit for tuners is well known, this leaves only the
equivalent circuit for a choke balun to allow us to analyze
our tuner-balun-antenna sytem using standard circuit theory.
<P>
Two useful and equivalent models of a choke balun are those
described by Walter Maxwell, W2DU and Roy Lewallen, W7EL. 
In Maxwell's model, of a choke balun, he uses the fact that
the coax shield is many skin depths thick so that it shields
the outside from fields on the inside of the coax.
The only place the fields can
escape is therefore at the end where the coax is connected
to a balun or to some other load. A well shielded transmitter
driving one end of the coax therefore can only produce external
fields
at the other end of the coax. You can think of the transmitter as
producing a voltage across the points where the center
conductor and the shield of the coax attach. At this point,
the internal fields escape, and can cause
currents to flow on the outside of the outer conductor of the
coax.
<P>
The equivalent setup is is shown in figure <A HREF="node4.html#f5">5</A>. The transmitter
applies a voltage between the inner and outer conductors
of the coax, and the outside of the outer conductor of the coax
is then another part of the system.  If I use no balun, and simply
connect our coax to the twinlead, center conductor to terminal 1 and
shield to terminal 2, the transmitter applies a voltage
across terminals 1 and 2 in figure <A HREF="node3.html#f4">4</A>. The outside of the outer
conductor presents an impedance 
<!-- MATH: Z_{\rm Shield} -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Shield</SUB> 
back to the case of the transmitter
which I have taken to be terminal 3. That means that this impedance is
placed from terminal 2 to 3 as shown in figure <A HREF="node4.html#f5">5</A>.

A choke balun made by coiling up coax would change the impedance
of the outside of the coax shield to the inductive reactance of the
coil. A choke balun made from ferrite beads slipped over the outside
of the coax will also increase this impedance. In his July 1983 QST
article 
Maxwell gave measurements of about  15.6 + <I>j</I>13.1  ohms per bead at 4 MHz
for #73 beads.
(However, I recently bought a bead balun kit at a hamfest which claimed to be
50 #73 beads. My balun measured  660 + <I>j</I>438  ohms or  13 + <I>j</I>9  ohms
per bead 4 MHz. Apparently, all beads are not created equal, and
it is prudent to make a few measurements to see how many beads
are needed to make a good balun with the your materials.)
Adding this impedance in series with 
<!-- MATH: Z_{\rm Shield} -->
 <I>Z</I><SUB>Shield</SUB>  gives
the balun common mode impedance  <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>  and 
the circuit shown in figure <A HREF="node4.html#f6">6</A>. Since there is only a single
connection to ground, I have dropped this connection to simplify the
circuit diagram. Notice that  <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>  is
connected in series with  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB>  so it effectively just increases  <I>Z</I><SUB>C</SUB> .

Maxwell's analysis gives a simple rule for understanding a choke
balun connected to the three terminal network given by our twinlead
fed antenna. Simply connect the balun common mode impedance from
the terminal 2 to 3, and drive the antenna across terminals 1 and
2. If the current through terminal 3 is made small enough by
the balun impedance, then the drive current is balanced between
terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
Roy Lewallen, W7EL, has given model of a choke balun by using
an ideal transformer as shown in figure <A HREF="node4.html#f7">7</A>.
The connection shown is schematically the same
as that normally drawn for a bifilar wound choke balun.
A real balun is not an ideal
transformer (nothing is), so the impedance  <I>Z</I><SUB>Balun</SUB>  is added.
The ideal transformer performs exactly the same task as the
independent generator in the W2DU model.
The W7EL model is equivalent to W2DU's
model. The advantage is that you can write down a complete equivalent
circuit for the tuner, balun, and antenna immediately without
applying Maxwell's rules.
