T-network tuners are popular for matching antennas for 160 through
10 meters. Recent articles by Frank Witt, AI1H[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/node1.html#witt">1</a>] and
Andrew Griffith, W4ULD,[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/node1.html#griffith">2</a>]
addressed how to measure
tuner loss for various resistive loads; gave some example
calculations and measurements; and showed how to adjust the tuner
for minimum loss.
Measuring your tuner's loss is the only sure way to know, but
by examining the worst case losses at various standing wave ratios,
some useful simplifications and estimates of tuner losses can be
made. Simple computer programs can accurately analyze your tuner once you
know the component values and all the numerical results here can be
obtained in this way, but
often a ``back of the envelope'' calculation can give
additional insight. You can, for example, look at a hamfest tuner,
or read the advertised specifications of a tuner,
and easily make an educated guess of the sort of power loss that you
can expect on 80 and 160 meters.

Since most of the loss
is in the coil, lossless capacitors are assumed, and
coil loss is included by the equivalent
parallel resistance   <i>QX</i><sub>L</sub> .

desired impedance  <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 50  ohms

The output resistance R and reactance X in series with the output
capacitor  <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>  are also transformed into their parallel equivalents.

The input impedance will be 50 ohms if the

The usual T-network has  <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> ,  <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> , and  <i>L</i>  all variable. Since there
are only two matching equations, many combinations will provide a match.
The optimum combination is the one that minimizes power loss.
The fractional power loss is the ratio of
parallel equivalent input resistance to the
the parallel coil resistance.
<p>
Notice that the parallel equivalent source and load resistances are
larger than either of the original source or load resistances. In
other words, any T-network will transform the load resistance
to a higher value which must also be higher than 50 ohms. It then
transforms this high value down to 50 ohms to produce a match.
Typical examples at
80 meters would be a 10 ohm load resistance transformed to a 4000 ohm
parallel equivalent which is transformed back to 50 ohms, while a
100 ohm load resistance might be transformed to 1000 ohms before
being transformed back to 50 ohms. The loss mechanism is now easier
to see. For these typical cases, the coil reactance will be 
around a few hundred ohms. The parallel equivalent coil resistance
for a coil of Q=100 would be 10 or 20 thousand ohms.
This resistance is enormous compared to 50 ohms and initially you might
be tempted to ignore it, but it is placed across a point in the circuit
where the impedance is transformed to a few thousand ohms. This means that
the loss would be of order 10 percent, hardly negligible if
a 1500 watt transmitter is used unless your coil is designed to
dissipate 150 watts.
<p>
As discussed by Griffith,
a typical T-network designed for 160 through 10 meters
has compromises. One of these is that the capacitors typically
have a maximum value of 200 to 300 pF. Another is that
L is usually a roller inductor. Tom Rauch, W8JI,
who has investigated the Q of some roller inductors
tells me that a rough estimate of the Q of
high quality, off the shelf, commercial roller inductors would range
from a low of around 20 at low values of inductance, up to
a maximum Q around 100. Custom roller inductors can have
a higher Q.  Since
80 and 160 meters are the lower frequency limits of these tuners,
and the antennas to be tuned there are often relatively short or far
from resonance, losses for these bands are important concerns.
Problems also occur at the high frequency limit of these tuners with
large stray reactances, component minimum
values, and low coil Q. Here I will concentrate only on performance
at lower frequencies.
<p>
Maximum loss occurs for low impedance loads. In figure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#f1.5">2</a>, I show
a smith chart where I have plotted points joined by straight lines
to approximate contours of constant loss. The inner group of points
corresponds to a loss of 0.3 dB, the middle group 0.5 dB, and the outer
group 1.0 dB loss. Because the contours are centered toward the right hand
side of the chart which corresponds to higher impedances, lower losses
tend to occur at higher impedances and higher losses at lower impedances
for a given SWR.

shows that while the maximum loss for a given SWR is at a slightly
capacitive load, an excellent approximation to the worst case

This numerical result is verified by analytical calculations which
show that the additional loss for the reactive load over the purely resistive
is given roughly by
an additional factor of 
<!-- MATH: R^2_0/(4 X^2_{C2}) -->
 <i>R</i><sup> 2</sup><sub>0</sub>/(4<i>X</i><sup> 2</sup><sub>C2</sub>)  which
changes the calculated loss by only a few percent.
<p>
The usefulness of these results is that the worst case loss can be approximated
simply. For typical capacitor values used and these low resistance loads,
the magnitude of the
capacitive reactances of  <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>  and  <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>  at 80 and 160 meters
is significantly larger than
either  <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>  or the load resistance  <i>R</i> ; a 250 pF capacitance

Eq. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq7">11</a> allows us to estimate the worst possible loss that
can occur with an output swr of  <i>s</i> . The loss can be a lot smaller;
for example if the swr is 5, but corresponds to a purely resistive
load of 250 ohms, Eq.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq7">11</a> greatly overestimates the loss.
However if the swr of 5 corresponds to a purely resistive load of
10 ohms, Eq.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq7">11</a> should fairly accurately predict the loss
<p>
Analytic calculations show that the least loss with a purely resistive
load will occur approximately when both capacitors are set to
the maximum value,
and the load resistance is R =  <i>X</i><sup> 2</sup><sub>C</sub>/<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>  where  <i>X</i><sub>C</sub>  is the reactance
of one of the capacitors. The minimum loss with a resistive
load is approximately half that of the loss for a matched load of
 <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 50  ohms if the coil Q remains the same.
This result and Eq. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq7">11</a> give reasonable upper
and lower bounds to the loss.
<p>
Only the product of the Q value of the coil and the maximum value
of the output capacitor needs to be measured or estimated to use Eq.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq7">11</a>.
The
maximum value of the capacitor is often given in the tuner specifications;
if not, it can be easily measured or estimated from handbook formulas
from the size, spacing, and number of plates. The coil Q can be guessed,
or, for a more accurate estimate,  measured using an r.f. bridge or Q meter.
Alternatively, measuring
the loss for a 50 ohm
load and then applying Eq.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq7">11</a> will give a value of  <i>QC</i><sub>max</sub> 
at the measurement frequency.
This matched loss can be measured by matching a 50 ohm dummy load with
your tuner and using
a power meter to measure the input and output powers.
Once  <i>QC</i><sub>max</sub>  is known, it can be used to calculate the worst
case loss at other SWR values.
<p>
Another popular tuner uses a differential T-network. In this
network the capacitors  <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>  and  <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>  are ganged together so
that their values sum to approximately  <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> . The worst case loss
can be calculated as before and is
<p align="CENTER">

The worst case loss of the differential T network is a factor of
2 worse at an SWR of 1, but becomes the same as the standard
T for large values of
SWR. This disadvantage is offset by the convenience of
having only 2 components
to adjust, and by the fact that one source of operator error is eliminated
since a really bad set of component
values cannot be chosen. This is unlike the standard network where the
operator can set the components to values that produce a match
but greatly increase losses.
<p>
Other T type configurations can be examined. The ultimate[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/node1.html#ultimate">3</a>]

In these, one of the capacitors in the network is replaced with a
two-section variable. For the ultimate transmatch, at 80 or 160 meters,
the reactance of the capacitor across the input is significantly larger than
50 ohms, so it has little effect. You can simply ignore it in the
loss analysis here; the extra section just increases the cost
of the transmatch without improving it.  The SPC transmatch has the
second section of the output capacitor connected across the
coil. The worst case loss of this circuit is always greater than
the standard T network.
The analysis above is easily extended by adding this
additional capacitance across the coil. For the SPC network, the
loss, when matching load resistances smaller than  <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> , is given by
<p align="CENTER">

where  <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>  is the maximum capacitance of one section of
the output capacitor for the SPC circuit. The loss is 50 percent
more than a standard T-network for an SWR of 1,
increasing to double the loss as the
output resistance drops. Unlike the differential T-network,
there does not appear to me to be any benefits from this
circuit that offset this additional loss.
<p>
It is amusing to compare the T-network results with those
of a simple L-network designed
to match a resistive low impedance load as shown in figure&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#f2">3</a>c.

For this resistive load, the simple L network is better by an overall factor of

<!-- MATH: |X_{C2}|/R_0 -->
 |<i>X</i><sub>C2</sub>|/<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>  which is  about a factor of 7 for  <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> 
of 250 pF at 160 meters. In addition, the loss for a load of 50 ohms
is zero (where the L and C values are both zero) and it increases
slower with SWR than for the T networks. The penalty is the limited matching
range. An L network tuner needs to be reconfigured to match a wide
range of loads; this switching of components can get complicated.
<p>
The peak voltage across the output capacitor of a T-network
for these loads can
also be calculated within these same approximations. Since the
series capacitors' reactance is significantly larger than 50 ohms,
the voltage across the source can be ignored to get an
estimate of the peak voltage.

measured was a Heath SA-2040 which has the ultimate transmatch
configuration. This tuner does not cover 160 meters.
The input capacitor has a maximum value of 125 pF, and the output
capacitor has a maximum value of 170 pF.
Because these values are not equal, a little care is needed.
For a 50 ohm input and output impedance, the capacitor values must
be equal. This means that the output capacitor can have a maximum
value of 125 pF for a match. However, when the output
resistance is reduced, Eq.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq4">5</a> can be applied to show that
for loads below about 
<!-- MATH: (125/170)^2 50 -->
 (125/170)<sup>2</sup>50  ohms or about 27 ohms, the full
170 pF value of the output capacitor can be used. The measured
loss with a 50 ohm load at 80 meters was 13 percent which corresponds
to 0.6 dB. Converting this into a Q value using  <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>  of 125 pF,
gives a Q of approximately 100, a reasonable value.
Using this Q value and a  <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>  value of 170 pF in Eq.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#eq7">11</a>,
gives the calculated values at other loads
shown in table&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808143000/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/tuner/tuner.html#t4">4</a> along with the
measured values. The values agree within about 10 percent. This
level of agreement is partially fortuitous,
but these results show that the simple ``back
of the envelope'' calculations work.

<p>
These results point out some fundamental problems
in using a 160 through 10 meter T-network
tuner at 80 and especially 160 meters.
Even feeding a resistive 50 ohm load with a tuner with
250 pF capacitors and a coil Q of 100 gives a loss of
about 0.6 dB. With a 1500 watt transmitter, the coil will
have to dissipate about 180 watts. I doubt if many tuners can
stand up to that. Increasing the SWR to 3, increases the worst
case loss to 1.3 dB, and the dissipation could increase to almost 400 watts.
Clearly a real 1500 watt 160 meter T-network tuner needs to have
significantly larger capacitors and a high quality coil in
a large cabinet to minimize loss.
<p>
I would like to thank Tom Rauch, W8JI, for reading a preliminary
version of this work, for many helpful comments,
and for providing me with reasonable estimates of the Q of the
coils in these networks.
