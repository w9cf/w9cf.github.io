<title> T-Network Tuner Simulation</title>

A T-Network Tuner Simulator, Kevin Schmidt, W9CF
</center>

Unsigned Java applets are now blocked by many browsers. You can run
the applet locally on your computer by downloading the jar file
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200816055718/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/tuner/tuner.jar">
http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/tuner/tuner.jar</a>. Double click this file to
run it. If that does not work, make sure java is installed. You can
also type
<br>
java -jar tuner.jar
<br>
on the command line.

<p>
This is a simulator for the popular, series capacitor, parallel inductor
T-network tuners. The three knobs across the bottom adjust the three
components. They can be turned by moving your mouse to a knob,
click and hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse around the outside
of the knob. The knob should turn. The capacitor knobs have 10 turns
between stops, and the coil knob has 30 turns between stops.
</p>

<p>
The SWR is shown both digitally in the upper left and on the SWR meter.
The loss in the tuner is shown as a percentage of input power and the
equivalent loss in decibels. Clicking the autotune button will attempt
to have your computer calculate values of the components
that should perfectly match the load and give low loss in the network
assuming that the capacitors
have much higher Q than the coil.
<p>
The autotune algorithm tries to
minimize the inductance used by first
finding a starting match by setting one of the capacitors
to its maximum value and if that fails it tries each of the components
at its current value. If no initial match is found, it gives up
and a "Tune Failed" will be written in the message panel.
If a starting match is found, a binary chop is done between the starting
inductance value and zero to find the smallest inductance consistent
with a match. Note it is straightforward to program a search algorithm
that finds the minimum loss, but since our tuners don't come with a loss
meter, a rule like tune for minimum inductance is much more useful.
In any case, the Q of real components changes as they are adjusted.
<p>
The Set Up button allows you to change
the maximum values of the three components and their Q values. Initially
the capacitors are 250 pF, Q=2000 and the coil is 30 microH, with Q=100.
</p>
<p>
The three fields on the right allow you to change the load and the
frequency in MHz.
</p>
<p>
One way to use this applet is to pick a load resistance and reactance,
and then adjust the knobs of the tuner for a match as you would do
on a real tuner. Note the percent loss in the tuner for your adjustment
and then click the autotune button to see if the computer adjusts
the tuner for less loss.
<p>
Note, if you are looking for design software for optimal networks with well
characterized components, please look elsewhere.
<p>
To run this locally, you can download the file
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200816055718/http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/tuner/tuner.jar">tuner.jar</a> and the file you are looking at
<a href="tuner.html">tuner.html</a> into any convenient directory
and point your browser at the tuner.html file. Old browsers may
require you to unzip the tuner.jar file in that directory (Jar files
are just zip files with an extra file that describes the contents).
Alternatively, you can run this as a Java application if you have
a java runtime environment installed.
